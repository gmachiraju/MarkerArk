_SNCA_ and _MAPT_ genes: Independent and joint effects in Parkinson disease in the Italian population
Significant efforts have been focused on investigating the contribution of common variants to Parkinson disease (PD) risk. Several independent GWAS and metanalysis studies have shown a genome-wide significant association of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the -synuclein (_SNCA_) and microtubule-associated protein tau (_MAPT_) regions. Here we investigated the role of _SNCA_ and _MAPT_ as PD susceptibility genes in a large Italian population of 904 patients and 891 controls. An evaluation of genegene and gene-environment interactions in association with PD was also attempted. The _SNCA_ Rep1 microsatellite was genotyped by a fluorescent PCR assay, whereas the SNPlex genotyping system was used to genotype 12 additional markers across the _SNCA_ gene, and 2 SNPs tagging the risk _MAPT_ H1 haplotype. Single-marker analysis demonstrated nominal evidence of association for: i) the 261-bp-long allele of Rep1; ii) 7 SNPs in the _SNCA_ region (top SNP: rs356186, _P_=3.081004, intron 4); iii) both SNPs identifying the _MAPT_ H1 haplotype (_P_=4.631004 and _P_=4.231004 for rs1800547 and rs9468, respectively). Moreover, we found a highly significant protective haplotype spanning 83kb from intron 4 to the 3 end of _SNCA_ (_P_=1.291005). Our findings strongly confirm _SNCA_ and _MAPT_ as major PD susceptibility genes for idiopathic PD in the Italian population. Interaction analyses did not evidence either epistatic effects between the two loci or gene-environment interactions. 
Parkinson disease (PD; OMIM#168600) is the second most common neurodegenerative disorder after Alzheimer disease, with a lifetime risk of developing the disease of 15%. Up to now, five major causative genes have been identified in Mendelian forms (_SNCA, PRKN, DJ1, PINK1, LRRK2_), although mutations in these genes collectively explain less than 10% of familial PD cases. In the vast majority of sporadic cases, the etiology is probably more complex, resulting from a combination of multiple environmental exposures (e.g.: pesticides, coffee consumption, cigarette smoking) and genetic risk factors acting on a background of aging. Indeed, a large amount of research has focused on identifying genetic variability that confers PD susceptibility. Among putative PD susceptibility genes, both the -synuclein gene (_SNCA_) and the microtubule-associated protein tau gene (_MAPT_) have been repeatedly investigated. _SNCA_ was the first causal gene identified in familial PD, and encodes -synuclein, a major component of Lewy bodies (LB), a pathologic hallmark of PD. The overproduction of -synuclein is the direct cause of LB accumulation in neural cells of familial PD cases, whereas a more subtle overproduction of otherwise normal -synuclein may contribute to PD pathogenesis in sporadic patients. Rep1 (GenBank D4S3481) is a complex polymorphic microsatellite repeat located 10kb upstream of the translation start site of _SNCA_. While several studies suggested that specific _SNCA_ Rep1 alleles are associated with late-onset idiopathic PD, others have observed no association or reported an inverse association between the risk allele and PD ( and references therein). After many small studies, Maraganore and colleagues finally confirmed the association between the Rep1 polymorphism and PD in a large meta-analysis using more than 5000 samples from 11 different sites. Moreover, functional analyses on the two most common Rep1 alleles (261bp and 259bp) suggested that the 261bp-long risk allele is associated with an up-regulation of _SNCA_ expression, whereas the 259bp-long protective variant shows reduced gene expression. In addition to variability in the promoter, genetic variation in the 3 untranslated region of _SNCA_ has been proposed to modulate predisposition to PD. Association of haplotypes within linkage disequilibrium (LD) blocks located in the 3 end of _SNCA_ with sporadic PD has been reported. Interestingly, a recent paper by Mata and colleagues showed a possible association between a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), rs356219, in the 3 region of the gene and _SNCA_ plasma levels. _MAPT_ encodes for the microtubule-associated protein tau, which regulates microtubule dynamics and assembles microtubules into parallel arrays within axons. The H1 and H2 haplotypes represent two distinct clades of subhaplotypes ensued from an inversion of 900kb on chromosome 17q21, spanning the entire _MAPT_ coding region, and are tagged, among others, by genotypes at two SNPs: rs9468 and rs1800547. The H1 haplotype has been significantly associated with an increased risk for a number of neurodegenerative diseases. Several studies proposed the _MAPT_ H1 haplotype as susceptibility factor also for PD. Associations of _SNCA_ and _MAPT_ with PD have been replicated not only in candidate gene studies, but also in several independent genome-wide association studies (GWAS), again suggesting the two genes as strong susceptibility factors for idiopathic PD in different populations. These data were further confirmed by a very recent meta-analysis of PD GWAS. However, no extensive investigations, including _SNCA_-_MAPT_ interaction or gene-environment analyses, have been performed on the Italian population. The present study was designed to investigate the role of _SNCA_ and _MAPT_ as susceptibility genes for PD in a large and well-characterized Italian population, and to evaluate possible interactions between the two loci. We studied 904 subjects with a diagnosis of PD and 891 controls who had contributed to the DNA Bank of the Parkinson Institute, Istituti Clinici di Perfezionamento, Milan, Italy (Human genetic bank of patients affected by Parkinson disease and parkinsonisms;. All patients were examined by movement disorder neurologists. The clinical diagnosis of PD was established according to the UK Parkinson Disease Society Brain Bank criteria (, and references therein) and required the presence of bradykinesia and at least one symptom among the followings: resting tremor, rigidity or postural instability, a positive response to dopaminergic therapy, and absence of atypical features or other causes of parkinsonism. The age at which the patient first noticed a PD-related symptom was considered the age of onset of the disease. Patients were classified as familial if at least one among their 1st or 2nd degree relatives had a formal diagnosis of PD. The remaining patients were classified as sporadic. The _LRRK2_ G2019S missense substitution was screened in all subjects, whereas the _PRKN_ gene was analyzed in all 62 PD patients with onset before the age of 40. _LRRK2_ and _PRKN_ mutation carriers were excluded from this study. Control subjects, unrelated to the patients and with negative family history for movement disorders, were recruited among spouses and care-givers. With the exception of 4 patients, originating from Argentina, Albania, and Greece, all the affected subjects and controls were of Italian origin. At the time of blood sampling, a standardized questionnaire, documenting medical diagnoses, lifestyle, and medications was filled in for all cases and controls. Smoking status was defined as current, former, or never smoker on the basis of self-reports (current and former smokers were grouped together in the single category of smokers in the statistical analyses). Coffee consumption was quantified on the basis of self-reports, with no consumption being defined as the intake of up to 2 coffee/day, and consumption as more than 2 coffee/day. The study was approved by the local Ethics Committee. All participants signed an informed consent. Genomic DNA extraction was performed from peripheral blood using a semi-automated extractor (QuickGene DNA Whole Blood Kit; FUJIFILM Europe GmbH Life Science, Dsseldorf, Germany). DNA samples were quantified using a BioPhotometer (Eppendorf AG, Hamburg, Germany), standardized for concentration, and arrayed into 96-deep-well plates. The _SNCA_ Rep1 region was PCR amplified from genomic DNA using the primer couple: 5-GACTGGCCCAAGATTAACCA-3 (fluorescently labeled with 6-FAM) and 5-CCTGGCATATTTGATTGCAA-3 (SigmaAldrich Co., St Louis, MO, USA). PCR products were resolved by capillary electrophoresis on an ABI-3130XL Genetic Analyzer (Applied Biosystem, Foster City, CA, USA). Allelic sizes were assessed using the GeneMapper v4.0 software (Applied Biosytems). On the basis of the length of PCR products, Rep1 alleles were coded as follows: allele 1=259bp, allele 2=261bp, allele 3=263bp, according to one of the previously described nomenclatures. Fourteen biallelic markers were selected within the _SNCA_ (12 SNPs) and _MAPT_ (2 SNPs) gene regions. The 12 _SNCA_ markers were chosen either on the basis of previous association data in Caucasian populations, or from dbSNP (); in all cases, SNPs showed a minor allele frequency of at least 20% in the general population, and were selected in order to both assure an adequate coverage of the _SNCA_ locus and meet the strict criteria for probe design of the genotyping assay. The 2 _MAPT_ SNPs were chosen because both tagged the H1/H2 haplotypes. Genotypes were determined using the Applied Biosystems SNPlex assay. Detection was performed on an ABI-3130XL Genetic Analyzer; data interpretation was performed with the GeneMapper software. Reproducibility was assessed by comparing replicated samples. The dependence of disease risk (the response variable) on potential explanatory factors [age, sex, smoking status, and coffee consumption] was analyzed with a conditional logistic regression model and statistical significance was tested using the likelihood ratio test and Walds test. In the regression, the response variable was set to 1 in cases and to 0 in controls. The effect of each explanatory factor was expressed as the odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) computed from the corresponding estimated regression coefficient in the model. Unadjusted ORs were obtained by using a model that included only the factor of interest; adjusted ORs were obtained by using a model that included the factor of interest plus all of the remaining factors. All procedures were performed using the R program, version 2.10.1. Allele and genotype frequencies of the Rep1 marker were calculated by using the Genepop program, option 5. The same software, option 1, was used to test the deviation from the HardyWeinberg equilibrium (HWE). Allelic and genotypic frequencies of Rep1 were compared by means of a __2 statistic, generated through the Monte Carlo approach using the CLUMP program. CLUMP uses the Monte Carlo procedure by measuring the differences in frequencies between cases and controls, and then produces multiple simulated datasets to calculate how many times the observed differences might be generated by chance if the frequencies were the same. Significance was assessed by carrying out 10,000 simulations. The use of the Monte Carlo simulation avoids the need for the Bonferroni (or others) correction. Analysis of deviation from HWE, genotyping success rate, allelic and genotypic frequencies, and association with PD of SNPs in _SNCA_ and _MAPT_ were performed using the PLINK software. For each SNP, standard casecontrol analyses on allele and genotype frequency data were performed with __2 statistics (Fisher exact test). In the text, all _P_-values for individual SNPs, OR, and 95% CI are presented as non-corrected for multiple testing and refer to the minor allele. Associations were also retested adjusting the logistic regression models for sex, smoking, and coffee consumption, previously tested for association with the disease, using the R software. For _SNCA_, the LD structure was determined from our SNP data using the Haploview v4.0 program. LD blocks were defined using the spine of LD setting. Haplotype-based association analysis was performed considering only those SNPs mapping within the same LD block, using the PLINK software. Power estimates indicated that, if each analyzed polymorphism (disease allele frequency of 10%) were to directly confer a 1.5-fold increase in the relative risk of PD, the case and control groups used in this research would be of sufficient size to have 99% power to detect a significant association at the 0.05 level. All secondary analyses were accomplished using the PLINK software. In particular, a pair-wise epistasis analysis of the 15 genotyped polymorphisms was performed using the --epistasis option, which provides a logistic regression test for interaction that assumes an allelic model for both the main effects and the interactions. A case-only analysis was also performed. For both analyses, only pairs of SNPs on different chromosomes (i.e. in linkage equilibrium) were considered. As for gene-environment interaction, we focused on smoking and coffee consumption, because their individual inverse associations with PD are well established. A Breslow-Day test of homogeneity of OR for the identification of possible interactions between _SNCA_/_MAPT_ with smoking and coffee consumption was performed. In this case, clusters were stratified according to the presence/absence of the habit for each SNP, and their disease/gene ORs compared. Demographics of the subjects included in this study are showed in. Among the 904 PD patients, 543 (60.1%) were male, the mean age at onset was 56.1 years (range 1482), and the mean disease duration was 10.6 years (range 442). Two hundred and eighty nine patients were classified as familial, the remaining subjects as sporadic. Coffee consumption and cigarette smoking habits were both more represented in controls than in cases, and showed a strong protective effect [OR=0.54 (95% CI=0.420.69) and OR=0.68 (95% CI=0.530.88), respectively]; also sex difference was very marked, but this is ascribable to a recruitment bias, as most controls are partners of PD patients. An association analysis on the entire PD cohort was performed by genotyping 15 polymorphic markers: the Rep1 microsatellite located in the 5 regulatory region of _SNCA_, 12 SNPs covering the whole _SNCA_ gene, and 2 SNPs, located 50kb apart from each other, both tagging the _MAPT_ H1/H2 haplotypes. The mean genotyping success rate was 90.2% and the accuracy was >99%, according to random duplicated genotyping of 5% of samples. Only one SNP, rs356221, did not result in HWE and was excluded from further analysis. Genotyping of the Rep1 polymorphism revealed three predominant alleles (length: 259bp, 261bp, and 263bp). Before the association test, rare alleles with frequencies less than 0.5% were excluded from the analysis, as previously described. Association was first tested using CLUMP. Rep1 did not demonstrate association in the allelic analysis, but showed a robust association in the genotypic analysis, being the three __2 statistics T2, T3, and T4 significant, and the forth one (T1) close to the significance level. In particular, frequency differences in cases vs. controls were striking for the 259/261 and 261/261 genotypes (33% vs. 40%, and 47.4% vs. 40.5%, respectively). Hence, association of Rep1 with PD was also analyzed assuming a biallelic model, only considering individuals carrying the 259 and/or 261 alleles (90% of cases and controls). This approach again revealed no association in the allelic analysis (adjusted _P_-value=0.398) (), but evidenced significant associations both in the genotypic analysis (_P_=0.005) and in the analysis performed assuming a dominant model of inheritance (_P_=0.004; the 261bp-long being the risk allele). Seven SNPs mapping in the _SNCA_ region showed a significant association with the disease; three retained their significance even after correction for covariates. One (rs2737029) of these resulted associated with an increased risk of PD (OR=1.22, 95% CI=1.031.44), whereas the remaining two showed a similar strength of association and a protective effect (top SNP rs356186, _P_=0.005, OR=0.74, 95% CI=0.590.91). Interestingly, these two SNPs were the only ones showing a significant association in the genotypic analysis. Both selected _MAPT_ SNPs showed a strong signal of association (top SNP: rs9468, _P_=0.00046, OR=0.69, 95% CI=0.560.85). The tagged H1 haplotype was over-represented in patients with respect to controls (81% vs. 76%; OR=1.39 and 1.45 for rs1800547 and rs9468, respectively). The association was also confirmed by genotype distribution analysis. LD within _SNCA_ was evaluated using Haploview. The whole region showed an overall strong degree of LD; nonetheless, 2 distinct haplotype blocks could be defined, one covering a 37kb-long region and corresponding to the 5 end of the gene, the other spanning from intron 4 to the 3 region of _SNCA_ (83kb). Haplotype analysis was accomplished considering only SNPs mapping within the same LD block. The CACCATAA haplotype, composed of SNPs rs356180-rs356219-rs356220-rs3775423-rs356203-rs356192-rs356186-rs2737029 (block 1), was less represented in PD cases (13.9%) respect to controls (19.6%), thus resulting a protective haplotype (_P_=1.291005). In block 2, a second protective haplotype was found (16.1 and 21.1% in patients and controls; _P_=21004), together with two predisposing haplotypes, whose frequency is however below 2%. Considering that some evidence suggests that genetic variants in _SNCA_ and _MAPT_ could interact in modulating risk for PD, an attempt to evaluate genegene interactions was performed. All pair-wise combinations of SNPs in linkage equilibrium (i.e. lying on different chromosomes) were tested, but no allelic epistasis was observed. A similar analysis, performed only on cases, did not show any significant interaction. Because both coffee consumption and smoking status showed a significant protective effect against PD, a preliminary test for homogeneity was used to identify their possible interactions with genotyped polymorphisms. However, no tendency to heterogeneity was detected between groups stratified according to the presence/absence of the habit for any SNP (lowest _P_-value=0.18) (data not shown). No further analysis was hence attempted. Many efforts have been focused on the identification of common variants conferring susceptibility to PD: replication studies on candidate genes, GWAS, and large meta-analyses provide a strong support for a role of _SNCA_ and _MAPT_ in the genetic predisposition to the disease. Considering that no extensive data on the Italian population are currently available, we investigated the involvement of _SNCA_ and _MAPT_ genetic variants in PD susceptibility in our cohort of 904 Italian PD patients and 891 controls. Concerning the _SNCA_ gene, we first analyzed the Rep1 polymorphism, confirming its association with PD and emphasizing the role of the 261bp-long allele as a risk factor for the disease, especially under the dominant model of inheritance. Indeed, the large meta-analysis performed by Maraganore and colleagues showed a robust association of both the Rep1 259bp-long allele (protective effect) and the 263bp-long allele (predisposing effect), but not of the 261bp-long allele. The lack of association of the Rep1 261bp-long allele in the meta-analysis could be due to the large fluctuation in its frequencies observed in the analyzed populations (range: 6271% and 6172% in cases and controls, respectively). In any case, our results well correlate with those reported by Cronin and colleagues, who studied the effects of three distinct Rep1 variants in the brains of human _SNCA_ transgenic mice. In animals homozygous for the risk allele (261bp), they observed a 1.7-fold increase of the _SNCA_ mRNA and a 1.25-fold increase in the protein level, suggesting that this allele may mimic _SNCA_ locus multiplication. Besides Rep1, we performed an association analysis between 12 SNPs covering the whole _SNCA_ gene region and PD. We found strong signals of association clustered in a region of 24kb located in the middle of _SNCA_ intron 4 (flanking SNPs: rs356186 and rs2197120; and ), where only few putative enhancers are reported (see the ENCODE track, UCSC Genome browser,. These signals were further confirmed by haplotype analysis, which revealed the existence of a strong protective allele spanning from the _SNCA_ 3 flanking region up to intron 4. Our results corroborate the hypothesis of a major susceptibility block located in the 3 region of _SNCA_ in Caucasian populations, as reported in other studies, but extend the putative susceptibility region toward intron 4, as previously hypothesized. Marker saturation of this overlooked region could provide more accuracy in defining LD blocks and haplotypes, thus hopefully facilitating the identification of functional variants underlying PD susceptibility. Since the discovery of the involvement of _MAPT_ in neurological disorders, several studies investigated its possible involvement in PD, especially in the light of in-vitro studies suggesting an interaction between the _MAPT_-encoded tau protein and -synuclein. Although initially controversial, mounting evidence now suggests the H1 haplotype as a strong PD susceptibility factor. The association study performed in our population further confirms the role of the H1-clade as risk allele: strong signals of associations were observed both in the allelic and in the genotypic analyses. In particular, the association we observed between the H1 haplotype (tagged by rs9468) and PD was highly significant (_P_=4.62104), and the effect size was even stronger than that observed for the best associated SNP in _SNCA_ (OR=1.45, 95% CI=1.181.78 vs. OR=1.35, 95% CI=1.11.69 for _MAPT_ and _SNCA_). Given our results both on _SNCA_ and _MAPT_, we attempted to evaluate potential genegene and gene-environment interactions. No pair-wise interaction was observed between polymorphisms of the two genes, with no evidence suggesting cumulative, synergistic, or antagonistic effects, as for the majority of other Caucasian populations ( and references therein). Only a few association studies have examined gene-environment interactions in PD, the most studied environmental exposures being coffee drinking and cigarette smoking. Cumulative and interactive effects of cigarette smoking and gene polymorphisms in _NOS1_ (neuronal nitric oxide synthase), _NOS2A_ (inducible nitric oxide synthase), and _SNCA_ were reported to modulate the risk of PD, whereas a significant interaction was observed between the _APOE_ gene and coffee intake. Our analysis, though performed on a relatively large number of PD cases and controls, failed to observe any interaction, again underscoring the need for larger association studies to define the role of gene-environment interactions in the development of PD. In conclusion, our results strongly confirm the susceptibility role of _SNCA_ and _MAPT_ genes in idiopathic PD in the Italian population, and add a further piece of information toward the future identification of the actual functional variants underlying these associations and the construction of a cumulative score of genetic variants to predict individual disease risk.
