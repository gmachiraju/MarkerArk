Macrosomia is associated with considerable neonatal and maternal morbidity. Factors that predict macrosomia are poorly understood. The increased rate of macrosomia in the offspring of pregnant women with diabetes and in congenital hyperinsulinaemia is mediated by increased foetal insulin secretion. We assessed the in utero and neonatal role of two key regulators of pancreatic insulin secretion by studying birthweight and the incidence of neonatal hypoglycaemia in patients with heterozygous mutations in the maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY) genes _HNF4A_ (encoding HNF-4) and _HNF1A/TCF1_ (encoding HNF-1), and the effect of pancreatic deletion of _Hnf4a_ on foetal and neonatal insulin secretion in mice. We examined birthweight and hypoglycaemia in 108 patients from families with diabetes due to _HNF4A_ mutations, and 134 patients from families with _HNF1A_ mutations. Birthweight was increased by a median of 790 g in _HNF4A_-mutation carriers compared to non-mutation family members (_p_ < 0.001); 56% (30/54) of _HNF4A_-mutation carriers were macrosomic compared with 13% (7/54) of non-mutation family members (_p_ < 0.001). Transient hypoglycaemia was reported in 8/54 infants with heterozygous _HNF4A_ mutations, but was reported in none of 54 non-mutation carriers (_p_ = 0.003). There was documented hyperinsulinaemia in three cases. Birthweight and prevalence of neonatal hypoglycaemia were not increased in _HNF1A_-mutation carriers. Mice with pancreatic -cell deletion of _Hnf4a_ had hyperinsulinaemia in utero and hyperinsulinaemic hypoglycaemia at birth. _HNF4A_ mutations are associated with a considerable increase in birthweight and macrosomia, and are a novel cause of neonatal hypoglycaemia. This study establishes a key role for _HNF4A_ in determining foetal birthweight, and uncovers an unanticipated feature of the natural history of _HNF4A_-deficient diabetes, with hyperinsulinaemia at birth evolving to decreased insulin secretion and diabetes later in life. 
_HNF4A_ mutations were found to be associated with a considerable increase in birthweight and macrosomia, and were a cause of neonatal hypoglycaemia. 
MODY, or maturity-onset diabetes of the young, is a particular subtype of diabetes; only a few percent of people with diabetes are thought to have this subtype. The condition comes about as a result of a mutation in one of six genes. Generally, people with MODY have high glucose (sugar) levels in the blood, and the typical symptoms of diabetes, such as increased thirst and urination, typically develop when the person is below the age of 25 y. Two of the genes that are known to cause MODY are mutant forms of _HNF4A_ and _HNF1A._ The proteins that are encoded by these two genes control insulin levels produced by the pancreas; when these genes are mutated, not enough insulin is produced. Without enough insulin to control blood sugar, levels rise, leading to the symptoms of diabetes. However, MODY can be managed by many of the same interventions as other types of diabetes, such as diet, exercise, drug treatments, and insulin injections. Although the evidence shows that individuals who carry mutations in _HNF4A_ and _HNF1A_ do not produce enough insulin and therefore have higher glucose levels in their blood, there were some tantalizing suggestions from mouse experiments that this might not be the whole story. Specifically, the researchers suspected that during embryonic development, mutations in _HNF4A_ or _HNF1A_ might actually cause higher insulin levels. Too much insulin during development of a fetus is known to cause it to gain weight, resulting in a baby that is larger than the average size for its age. Larger babies are risky for both the baby and the mother. The researchers doing this study wanted to understand more precisely what the links were between the forms of MODY caused by _HNF4A_ and _HNF1A_ mutations, and birth-weight and blood-sugar levels. In this study, the researchers examined 15 families in which some family members had MODY caused by a mutation in _HNF4A._ They compared the birthweight for family members carrying the mutation (54 people) against the birthweight for those who did not (54 people). A similar comparison was done for 38 families in which some members had a different form of MODY, this time caused by a mutation in _HNF1A._ The results showed that the birthweight of family members who carried a mutation in _HNF4A_ was, on average, 790 g higher than the birthweight of family members who didn't carry the mutation. Low blood-sugar levels at birth were also more common in people carrying the _HNF4A_ mutation as compared to people who did not. However, the _HNF1A_ mutation did not seem to be associated with greater birthweight or low blood-sugar levels at birth. Finally, in order to understand these findings further, the researchers created embryonic mice carrying mutations in the mouse equivalent of _HNF4A._ These embryos produced more insulin than normal mouse embryos and, after birth, were more likely to have low blood-sugar levels. These findings show that there is a link between mutations in _HNF4A,_ but not in _HNF1A,_ and increased birthweight. The increase found in this study is quite substantial (a median weight of 4,660 g in the affected babies; a birthweight of more than 4,000 g is generally considered large). The results suggest that in human embryos with a mutated form of _HNF4A,_ too much insulin is produced during development, causing faster growth and a higher chance of the baby being born with low blood-sugar levels. This is an unexpected finding, because later in life the _HNF4A_ mutation causes lower insulin levels. Therefore, the biochemical pathways causing this type of MODY seem to be quite complicated, and further research will need to be done to fully understand them. Crucially, the research also suggests that pregnant women carrying _HNF4A_ mutations should be closely followed to check their baby's growth and minimize the chance of complications. Doctors and families should also consider doing a genetic test for _HNF4A_ if a baby has low blood-sugar levels and if there is a family history of diabetes; this would increase the chance of diagnosing MODY early.

Macrosomia is associated with considerable foetal and maternal morbidity []. Factors that predict macrosomia are still poorly understood []. In humans, foetal insulin secretion is one of the key determinants of foetal growth, acting mainly in the third trimester when the weight of the foetus increases greatly. This is seen in pregnant women with diabetes when foetal sensing of maternal hyperglycemia drives insulin secretion, insulin-mediated growth, and subsequent macrosomia. In addition to such environmental factors, mutations in the genes involved in insulin secretion are also known to affect birthweight. Mutations that cause hyperinsulinaemic hypoglycaemia of infancy [] are associated with increased birthweight. Conversely, genes in which mutations cause neonatal diabetes [,] and some forms of maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY) [,] are associated with decreased birthweight. The transcription factors hepatocyte nuclear factor-4 (encoded by the _HNF4A_ gene), and hepatocyte nuclear factor-1 (encoded by _HNF1A,_ approved gene name _TCF1_) play a key role in the regulation of pancreatic insulin secretion. _HNF4A_ and _HNF1A_ mutations cause monogenic diabetes (MODY 1 and MODY3, respectively) due to decreased insulin secretion [,] and are key parts of an important -cell network [,]. In the pancreas, _HNF1A_ and _HNF4A_ form part of a common transcriptional network, which has been proposed as an explanation of the shared pancreatic phenotype seen in patients with mutations in these genes []. Variants in the _HNF4A_ pancreatic promoter have also been associated with Type 2 diabetes [,]. A recent study reported mildly reduced blood glucose and increased insulin levels in adult -cell _Hnf4a_deficient mice []. As a result of this animal study, we hypothesized that mutations in the human gene _HNF4A_ might increase foetal insulin secretion and birthweight, and cause neonatal hyperinsulinaemia and hypoglycaemia. We therefore studied birthweight and reported hypoglycaemia in _HNF4A_-mutation carriers and unaffected family members. As a comparison, we also studied the families of patients with mutations in the closely associated pancreatic transcription factor _HNF1A._ To investigate the mechanism of neonatal hypoglycaemia and increased birthweight, we also studied foetal and neonatal mice lacking both copies of _Hnf4a_ in the pancreas. One hundred and eight members (54 mutation carriers) of 15 families who had been found to have MODY due to an _HNF4A_ mutation, were contacted. This group included 13 families where the mutation had previously been identified as well as two families, found after screening for _HNF4A,_ where there was both neonatal hypoglycaemia and diabetes in a family member (see below). Where mutation status of an individual within a family had not previously been determined, DNA was extracted from a buccal sample. _HNF4A_ was amplified and sequenced as previously described []. Birthweight and gestational age were primarily obtained by maternal recall. Birth centiles and weight were corrected to 40 wk of gestation and for male sex, according to UK 1990 reference curves []. In assessment of neonatal hypoglycaemia, we report here on three patients from two families described above in whom _HNF4A_ mutations had been identified due to coexistent familial diabetes and neonatal hypoglycaemia. In addition, we contacted 101 unselected members (48 mutation carriers) of the 13 families described above who had been found previously to have MODY due to an _HNF4A_ mutation. In babies born to mothers with diabetes during pregnancy, hypoglycaemia that did not require intravenous glucose and lasted for less than 24 h was not considered exceptional. Any other reported incidence of hypoglycaemia at birth was followed up by case-note review. An episode of hypoglycaemia was established only if venous plasma glucose of less than 2.5 mmol/l was documented. All investigations for hyperinsulinaemic hypoglycaemia were done by the referring clinician at the time of diagnosis using their local laboratory. After our initial observations in families with known _HNF4A_ mutations, we went on to sequence the _HNF4A_ gene in the probands of five further families who had been referred to the Exeter Molecular Genetics Laboratory with hyperinsulinaemic hypoglycaemia, and who had at least one first-degree relative with diabetes. No monogenic cause had been found for the hypoglycaemia or diabetes in these families: three of the hypoglycaemic probands had been sequenced for activating _GCK_ and/or _KCNJ11_ mutations and, in one family, members with diabetes had been sequenced for _HNF1A_ mutations. One hundred and thirty-four members (85 mutation carriers) from 38 families with known MODY due to an _HNF1A_ mutation were contacted. Reported birthweight and hypoglycaemia were recorded in the same way as for _HNF4A_-mutation carriers. -cellspecific _Hnf4a_ mutations (-_Hnf4a-_KO) were generated by crossing _Hnf4a_LoxP/LoxP mice (Jackson Laboratory, ) [] with InsPr-Cre mice, a transgenic line expressing Cre recombinase driven by the rat insulin 2 promoter []. Both lines were bred on a C57BL/6J genetic background. An almost complete efficiency of recombination of _Hnf4a_ LoxP alleles in -cells was verified by: (1) real-time PCR quantitation in RNA from isolated islets showing an 80% reduction of _Hnf4a_ mRNA relative to control mice (); (2) absent Hnf-4 staining in >90% -cells on immunofluroescence analysis (unpublished data); and (3) recombination of a Rosa26LoxP-Stop-LoxP-Lacz allele in >90% of -cells when crossed with InsPr-Cre (unpublished data). Blood insulin and glucose were obtained after decapitation of timed embryos or neonatal mice (1520 mice per genotype and stage). Glucose was measured with a glucose meter (Accu-Chek, Roche []). Plasma insulin levels were determined by ELISA (Mercodia,. Genotyping was performed by PCR analysis using genomic DNA isolated from the tail tips of embryos and newborn mice. Isolated islets from 68-wk-old -_HNF4a-_KO mice and control _Hnf4a_LoxP/LoxP littermates were used for RNA extraction with Trizol reagent (Invitrogen,. RNA integrity was verified with the 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies, ) prior to reverse transcription and real-time PCR quantitation as described []. Oligonucleotide sequences are available upon request. Owing to the non-normal distribution of birthweight data, non-parametric analysis was used. Median centiles and birthweights were compared using the Mann-Whitney U-test. For the discordant sibling analysis, the median birthweight corrected for sex and gestation for all mutation carriers and non-mutation carriers within a sibship were compared using the Wilcoxon signed rank test. Hypoglycaemia and macrosomia categorical data were compared using Fisher's Exact test. Data from the mouse studies are presented as mean  standard error of the mean, and were compared by the two-tailed Student's _t_-test. This study was approved by the North and East Devon Regional Ethics Committee, UK and the Animal Ethics Committee of the University of Barcelona School of Medicine, Spain. All patients or carers gave informed consent. The characteristics of all the _HNF4A_-mutation carriers and their unaffected family members are shown in. The median birthweight of the _HNF4A_-mutation carriers was the 96th centile (interquartile range 75100) compared with the 58th centile (interquartile range 3376) in unaffected family members, giving a difference in corrected median birthweight of 790 g, _p_ < 0.001 (A). A difference in birthweight was seen both when the mutation was inherited from the father, _p_ < 0.001 (B) or from the mother, _p_ < 0.001 (C). There was no effect of offspring genotype on gestational age at delivery (_p_ = 0.29). The influence of _HNF4A_ genotype on birthweight remained significant if the individuals from the two families referred with hyperinsulinaemia were excluded (_p_ < 0.001). Nineteen mothers who were mutation carriers and one mother who was not a mutation carrier had diabetes during pregnancy; 11 of the 20 offspring from these pregnancies were mutation carriers. Finally, to allow for any impact of maternal hyperglycaemia, corrected median birthweight was compared in 18 sibling pairs discordant for the presence of the _HNF4A_ mutation. The median birthweight of the mutation-carrying siblings was 4,660 g compared with a median birthweight of the non-mutation-carrying siblings of 3,640 g, _p_ = 0.001 (D). Macrosomia, defined as a birthweight of more than 4,000 g, was present in 56% of _HNF4A_-mutation carriers but in only 13% of non-mutation carriers (_p_ < 0.001). The prevalence of macrosomia was 64% if the _HNF4A_ mutation was inherited from the mother and 46% if the _HNF4A_ mutation was inherited from the father. In contrast in an unaffected foetus, the equivalent rates were 25% with an affected mother (_p_ = 0.07), and 6% with an affected father (_p_ = 0.003). Macrosomia is associated with increased foetal and maternal morbidity, and this was seen in some of the patients. The deliveries of the two siblings from family 1,023 were both complicated by severe shoulder dystocia, with 1,0231 developing an Erb's palsy. The prevalence of extreme macrosomia, defined as a birthweight of >5,000 g, which is associated with increased neonatal mortality [], was 15% (four neonates) in _HNF4A_-mutation carriers with an affected mother and 7% (two neonates) in _HNF4A_-mutation carriers with an affected father. No non-mutation carriers had extreme macrosomia. Transient neonatal hypoglycaemia is a feature of some _HNF4A_-mutation carriers. Two out of five families referred to Exeter, with hypoglycaemia and a first-degree family member with diabetes, were shown to have novel _HNF4A_ mutations (M364R, IVS4nt-2A>G). Three out of the six mutation carriers in these families had documented neonatal hypoglycaemia (;. In addition, five out of 48 _HNF4A_-mutation carriers in families previously identified with MODY had hypoglycaemia at or soon after birth lasting > 24 h and requiring treatment. So, overall, eight out of 54 mutation carriers had neonatal hypoglycaemia compared to none of the 54 non-mutation carriers (_p_ = 0.003). If the patients from the two additional families are excluded, there is still a significant excess of hypoglycaemia in the mutation carriers (_p_ = 0.02). The clinical features of the eight cases with established hypoglycaemia during infancy associated with _HNF4A_ mutations are shown in. Their pedigrees () show that hypoglycaemia was often described only in a single family member with other carriers of the same _HNF4A_ mutation presenting with diabetes. The prevalence of hypoglycaemia was similar if the mutation was inherited from the father (four out of 27 patients) or from the mother (four out of 27 patients), suggesting that persisting neonatal hypoglycaemia is independent of maternal glycaemia in pregnancy. In six patients, the hypoglycaemia was treated with intravenous glucose and enteral feeding, but two patients (1,0181 and 1,309) required treatment with diazoxide and chlorothiazide for 1 and 6 mo, respectively. In both cases, there was documented inappropriate hyperinsulinaemia in the presence of hypoglycaemia. To directly test whether _Hnf4a_ deficiency affects insulin secretion in utero, mice with -cellspecific _Hnf4a_ deletion (-_Hnf4a_-KO) were examined during late gestation (E18.5E20). Late-gestation -_Hnf4a_-KO embryos exhibited significantly elevated insulin concentrations (118.14  16.62 pmol/l versus 69.75  11.03 pmol/l in -_Hnf4a_-KO versus controls, _p_ = 0.019) (A). Glucose concentrations, which are regulated by the mother, were similar in both groups (A). Birthweight, which in mice does not exhibit insulin dependence as in humans [], did not differ in -_Hnf4a_-KO mice. During the neonatal period, blood glucose values were low relative to control littermates (1.35  0.35 mmol/l versus 2.50  0.28 mmol/l, respectively, _p_ = 0.018) (B). Blood glucose levels below 1.1 mmol/l were observed at least seven times more frequently in neonatal -_Hnf4a_-KO neonatal mice than in controls (8/15 versus 2/28, respectively, _p_ < 0.001). This hypoglycaemia was due to increased insulin secretion, as the insulin/glucose ratio values in -_Hnf4a_-KO versus control mice were 29.8  12.0 versus 5.6  1.5 (_p_ = 0.01), while insulin values were 23.9  6.9 pmol/l versus 11.1  3.3 pmol/l (_p_ = 0.053), respectively (B). The expression of genes causing human hyperinsulinaemic hypoglycaemia, namely _Kcnj11_ (encoding Kir6.2), _Abcc8_ (encoding Sur1), _Schad, Gck,_ and _Glud1,_ was unaltered in _Hnf4a_-deficient islets. In summary, these findings indicate that _Hnf4a_ deficiency causes hyperinsulinism during foetal and neonatal life, supporting the suggestion that this is the underlying cause of macrosomia and hypoglycaemia in _HNF4A_-mutation carriers. The characteristics of the _HNF1A_-mutation carriers and their unaffected family members are shown in. Unlike _HNF4A,_ mutations in _HNF1A_ are not associated with an increased birthweight (A), with a median difference of 10 g (_p_ = 0.86) and a mean difference in the analysis of 24 discordant sibling-pairs (B) of 3g (_p_ = 0.91). Only one _HNF1A_-mutation carrier had neonatal hypoglycaemia requiring intravenous glucose and persisting for longer than 24 h; however, his mother had diabetes during pregnancy, and he required less than 48 h of this treatment. Hypoglycaemia was more common in _HNF4A_-mutation carriers (eight out of 54) than in _HNF1A_-mutation carriers (one out of 77), _p_ = 0.004. We have shown that increased birthweight and macrosomia are common features of patients with _HNF4A_ mutations and, in addition, that some individuals with _HNF4A_ have neonatal hypoglycaemia. Although in young adults the same genetic defect results in diabetes due to reduced insulin secretion [,], we have shown that the mechanism for the phenotype in newborns is likely to be increased insulin secretion in utero and in the neonatal period. This is supported by hyperinsulinaemia in some affected infants with _HNF4A_ mutations, and studies in mice with -cell deletion of _Hnf4a_ clearly show hyperinsulinaemia in utero and hyperinsulinaemic hypoglycaemia in the early neonatal period. _HNF4A_-mutation carriers are, on average, 790 g heavier than their family members who do not carry the mutation, and 56% are born with macrosomia (>4,000 g). The increase in birthweight is similar to that seen in the offspring of patients with maternal diabetes which is the commonest recognized cause of macrosomia. Forty-six percent of children with an _HNF4A_ mutation born to affected fathers had macrosomia. This is a clear example that macrosomia may result from foetal genetics as well as from the maternal intra-uterine environment. Consideration of this should be taken into account when determining macrosomia risk, and we recommend that, in addition to maternal diabetes, a history of young-onset non-insulin-requiring paternal diabetes should prompt assessment of foetal size. We have described eight patients with _HNF4A_ mutations who had one or more episodes of hypoglycaemia in the neonatal period; there was hyperinsulinaemia in all three patients who were tested. Five patients required treatment with intravenous glucose only, with resolution within 1 mo; this finding was consistent with a transient hyperinsulinaemia. Two patients had more persistent hypoglycaemia which responded well to treatment with diazoxide and chlorothiazide and subsequently resolved. Therefore, the loss of _HNF4A_ function causes a relatively mild form of hyperinsulinaemic hypoglycaemia that is transient and diazoxide-responsive. Transient hypoglycaemia is often not investigated and as a result is understudied. We propose that neonates presenting with hypoglycaemia who have a father with diabetes, or a mother with young-onset non-insulin-requiring diabetes, should be screened for _HNF4A_ mutations. However, three out of the five unselected _HNF4A_-mutation carriers with neonatal hypoglycaemia presented before their respective parent developed diabetes. Therefore, we also suggest that _HNF4A_ mutations should be considered in any child with persistent hypoglycaemia (>24 h). We encountered two problems resulting from the retrospective nature of this study. Firstly, hospital records were not readily available so birthweight and gestational age were ascertained by parental recall in the majority of cases. However, all this data collection was done blind to genotype and therefore any error should apply to both offspring groups. Secondly, the hypoglycaemia was often not well investigated at the time of presentation, presumably because of its transient nature. Hence, hyperinsulinaemia at birth was looked for only in three out of the eight patients presenting with hypoglycaemia, and other causes of hyperinsulinaemia were not excluded. It also means that we are uncertain whether the 46 patients with _HNF4A_ mutations in whom hypoglycaemia was not described had undetected hypoglycaemia or were not hypoglycaemic. A prospective study of neonates born to _HNF4A_-mutation carriers is required for a complete assessment of the hyperinsulinaemic hypoglycaemia seen in these patients. The increased birthweight and risk of macrosomia in _HNF4A_-mutation carriers is likely to be secondary to foetal hyperinsulinaemia. Although no measures of foetal insulin or cord insulin were available to confirm this mechanism in humans, two lines of evidence support it. Firstly, in humans, we have documented hyperinsulinaemia soon after birth in the three patients in whom it was tested, and hypoglycaemia in eight. Secondly, we have shown that mice lacking pancreatic _Hnf4a_ have increased insulin concentrations in utero, and hyperinsulinaemic hypoglycaemia as newborns. The increased birthweight and neonatal hypoglycaemia in _HNF4A-_mutation carriers seems paradoxical for a gene that is associated with a -celldeficient form of young-onset diabetes [,], particularly as the decreased -cell function has been explained by decreased expression of pancreatic -cell genes involved in glucose metabolism [,]. It is in contrast to other monogenic causes of diabetesfor example, _GCK_ [], _IPF1_ [], _HNF1B_ [], or activating _KCNJ11_ [,] and _ABCC8_ mutations [,] where birthweight is reduced. In these cases, the low insulin secretion that causes diabetes later is associated with decreased insulin-mediated foetal growth. In _HNF4A_-mutation carriers, in contrast, there would need to be a switch from increased insulin secretion in utero and neonatal life to decreased insulin secretion in later life. The closest example of this is patients with hyperinsulinaemia of infancy due to recessive and dominant mutations in KATP channel subunits, who have a high rate of diabetes at long-term follow-up even when they do not receive pancreatic surgery [,,]. It has been postulated that diabetes in SUR1-deficient patients reflects increased apoptosis, in addition to abnormal regulation of secretion due to lack of KATP channels []. Compared to SUR1 deficiency, HNF-4 deficiency results in less severe hyperinsulinism, yet gives rise to a more highly penetrant and severe diabetic phenotype. It is interesting, however, that of the eight patients who developed established hypoglycaemia at birth, five developed diabetes by the age of 14 y (mean age 12.4 y), suggesting a possible earlier progression to diabetes in this group. Two recent studies surprisingly showed that -cell _Hnf4a_ deficiency does not cause diabetes in mice [,]. One study paradoxically reported mildly reduced blood glucose and increased insulin levels in adult -cell _Hnf4a_-deficient mice, and ascribed this to diminished expression of _Kcnj11_ encoding the KATP channel subunit Kir6.2 []. Another study failed to confirm abnormal blood glucose and insulin levels, and reported normal _Kcnj11_ expression []. This discrepancy, together with the unexpected failure to develop hypoinsulinaemic diabetes, led us to question whether hyperinsulinaemia was an important feature of _Hnf4a_ deficiency. In the current study, we have shown that, in parallel with the human findings, _Hnf4a_deficient mice exhibit hyperinsulinaemia in the foetal and neonatal stage, as well as overt neonatal hypoglycaemia as opposed to only mildly reduced glucose at later ages as recently reported []. Importantly, our studies showed no abnormal expression of _Kcnj11_. While discrepancies in phenotype might be explained by small differences in genetic background, the current data suggest that the hyperinsulinaemic phenotype in _Hnf4a_ deficiency is not related to KATP channel expression. Further studies will need to address how Hnf-4-dependent transcription in -cells is linked to the dual phenotype reported here. Large-scale profiling shows that Hnf-4-deficient -cells exhibit abnormal expression of more than 10% of all islet genes (unpublished observations), many of which need to be examined as plausible candidates for the _HNF4A_-deficient hypersecretory phenotype. It is tempting to hypothesize that the initial defect that causes -cell hypersecretion might eventually lead to -cell exhaustion and diabetes, in analogy to what is observed in some patients with SUR1 mutations as described above [,,]. However, the broad transcriptional phenotype of _Hnf4a-_deficient mice offers an alternative potential explanation, whereby one HNF-4-dependent gene-expression defect causes hypersecretion early in life, while a separate gene-expression defect is responsible for the development of severe -cell failure several years after birth. The birthweight and incidence of hypoglycaemia in heterozygous _HNF1A_-mutation carriers were not different from their unaffected family members. This finding suggests that foetal insulin secretion is not increased in _HNF1A_-mutation carriers. Previous data had supported a common phenotype of _HNF1A-_ and _HNF4A_-mutation carriers, due to a regulatory transcription factor circuit in the -cell with positive feedback on expression between HNF-1 and HNF-4 [,,,]. Our findings suggest that, at least in foetal life, there are clearly independent functions of these two transcription factors in the foetal -cell. Our data therefore suggest that, in humans, the proposed transcription-factor network is not critically required in foetal development and early post-natal life. Serial antenatal scans should be performed in any pregnancy in which the father or mother is a mutation carrier and early induction of labour is considered. This is true when the mother does not have diabetes, but particularly applies when the mother has diabetes or impaired glucose tolerance in pregnancy. All offspring of pregnancies where the father or mother is an _HNF4A_-mutation carrier should be tested for neonatal hypoglycaemia at birth and also 24 h after birth. In families where there is autosomal dominant inheritance of young-onset diabetes with features consistent with a diagnosis of MODY, details of birthweight and neonatal hypoglycaemia should be specifically asked for. When macrosomia or neonatal hypoglycaemia (>24 h) is described, _HNF4A_ should be sequenced before other genes when performing diagnostic genetic testing. _HNF4A_ should be sequenced in children with neonatal hypoglycaemia, particularly if the hypoglycaemia is relatively mild or transient, or if a family member (parent or grandparent) has young-onset diabetes (<35 y). In patients diagnosed as having _HNF4A,_ resolution of symptoms should be expected in the first year, but diabetes should be expected to develop in adolescence or in early adulthood and should be screened for annually after the age of 10 y. _HNF4A_ should be sequenced as part of an investigation of unexplained macrosomia, particularly when the macrosomia is extreme, is accompanied by hypoglycaemia, or there is a family history of early-onset diabetes. To conclude, we have shown that heterozygous _HNF4A_ mutations are associated with a 790 g increase in birthweight, on average, and considerable risk of macrosomia. The increased birthweight is probably mediated by increased foetal insulin secretion and, in some cases, is associated with transient neonatal hyperinsulinaemia. Because _HNF4A_ deficiency is also known to cause hypoinsulinaemic diabetes, this study shows for the first time that HNF-4 has dual opposing roles in the -cell during different periods of life. This study also has important implications for clinical practice (see. Firstly, pregnancies where a parent is known to have an _HNF4A_ mutation should be monitored closely during pregnancy and the immediate post-natal period to minimize complications of macrosomia and neonatal hypoglycaemia. Secondly, neonates with transient or persistent hypoglycaemia and/or macrosomia and a family history of young-onset diabetes should be considered for _HNF4A_ molecular genetic testing. Thirdly, since the foetal genotype has a considerable impact on determining birthweight, in addition to maternal factors, paternal factors (including history of diabetes) should be considered when assessing macrosomia risk. The GenBank () identification numbers for the genes and gene products discussed in this paper are _HNF1A/TCF1_ (NM_000545.3) and _HNF4A_ (NM_000457.3).
