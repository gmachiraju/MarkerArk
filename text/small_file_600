correlation is observed between CTC enumeration
and AGR2 mRNA level (R2 ¼ 0.74, P < 0.001, Fig. 1).
We conclude that AGR2 mRNA is expressed in CTCs
from patients with metastatic CRPC.
Plasma AGR2 Levels are Elevated in Metastatic
Prostate Cancer
Having demonstrated CTC-based expression of
AGR2 mRNA in CTCs, we next expanded our study
to examine plasma AGR2 levels in patients with metastatic prostate cancer. Since AGR2 is known to be
an androgen-regulated, secreted protein which is
elevated in plasma in ovarian and pancreatic cancer

5

[23,24], we reasoned that plasma AGR2 levels may be
elevated and vary in response to therapies in patients
with metastatic prostate cancer.
An ELISA assay was used to explore plasma AGR2
and CGA levels in patients with metastatic prostate
cancer compared with normal controls (Fig. 2). Consistent with other reports, we observed a median
(range) of 25 (6–170) ng/ml AGR2 in normal male
subjects (n ¼ 18). However, we found that plasma
AGR2 values were significantly elevated in each cohort of patients with metastatic prostate cancer. Specifically, we observed AGR2 values of 105 (20–285), 75
(10–2500), and 945 (50–1,035) ng/ml for patients in
the CSPC, CRPC, and NE-CRPC cohorts, respectively
(P < 0.05 for each comparison). The median (range)
of CGA levels in normal subjects was 70 (22–714)
ng/ml, which is consistent with the assay’s normal
value of <100 ng/ml. We observed CGA values of 68
(39–206), 92 (10–551), and 174 (151–235) ng/ml for
patients in the CSPC, CRPC, and NE-CRPC cohorts,
respectively. Only the NE-CRPC cohort had significantly different CGA levels than normals (P < 0.05).
We conclude that plasma AGR2 is significantly
elevated in patients with metastatic prostate cancer
compared with normal male controls.
Plasma AGR2 Levels do not CorrelateWith PSA
Serum PSA levels are almost uniformly elevated in
patients with metastatic prostate cancer, where it is
used as a therapeutic biomarker [30]. As both PSA
and AGR2 levels are androgen regulated secreted
proteins, we explored whether AGR2 levels correlate

with PSA. First, we explored whether plasma AGR2
relates to PSA on a per sample basis and found a
weak and non-significant correlation (R2 ¼ 0.08,
P ¼ 0.07; Supplementary Figure). Next, as changes in
PSA values are used as a biomarker associated with
response to multiple therapies in CRPC, we explored
sequential measurements of AGR2 and PSA. In 10
subjects (CRPC n ¼ 7, CSPC n ¼ 2, NE-CRPC n ¼ 1),
sequential samples were available representing baseline and serial measurements at weeks 3–6 and 10–12
in response to standard therapies (Fig. 3). In this preliminary analysis, we observe no clear trend in comparing changes in PSA or AGR2 values in response to
standard therapies. In some subjects, a ‘‘discordant’’
pattern is observed such that AGR2 levels changed
inversely with PSA values (Fig. 3E, H, and I). In other
subjects AGR2 levels seemed to closely track declining (Fig. 3A, B, and J) or increasing (Fig. 3C) PSA values. A third pattern with stable AGR2 levels despite
decreasing PSA (Fig. 3D, F, and G) was also observed.
We conclude that plasma AGR2 and PSA vary independently in relation to treatments used for metastatic
prostate cancer.

AGR2 Expression is Associated With a
‘‘Neuroendocrine Phenotype’’
We noted that the sub-group of patients with the
highest median AGR2 expression included three subjects with NE-CRPC. As NE-CRPC remains generally
a poorly defined clinical entity, we sought to more
precisely describe the clinical and serologic characteristics of these patients (Table II). As expected, patients
with NE-CRPC exhibit an unusual pattern of metastatic spread which includes sites such as lung, liver,
bone, eye, and brain in addition to the conventional
metastatic pattern involving osteoblastic metastases
to bone. Chromagranin A (CGA) and other blood
based markers are commonly used to help characterize patients with NE-CRPC [31]. We note that CGA is
elevated in all subjects with NE-CRPC. Other serum
markers such as carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) and
neuron-specific enolase (NSE) are also elevated along
with AGR2 in many of these subjects as well. We conclude that plasma AGR2 may be used along with
CGA, and other serum markers, to help define NECRPC.

AGR2 is a Biomarker of Metastatic Prostate Cancer
As NE-CRPC represents an uncommon clinical
variant of metastatic prostate cancer, we used prostate
cancer cell lines to further explore a possible association between AGR2 and neuroendocrine marker expression in prostate cancer cells (Fig. 4). PC3 is a
human prostate cancer cell line which is known to express high levels of AGR2 and exhibit other characteristics associated with neuroendocrine prostate cancer
[9,10,32]. 22Rv1 is an androgen-responsive human
prostate cancer cell line which was also found to
expresses AGR2 and is tumorogenic in immune-compromised mice [33,34]. PC3 and 22Rv1 cells were
infected with a lentivirus expressing shRNA against
AGR2 or a scrambled-shRNA as a control. Down-regulation of AGR2 expression in PC3 and 22Rv1 cells
resulted in concordant decreases in CGA levels compared to cells infected with scramble-shRNA control
virus (Fig. 4, left and middle panels). DU145 represents and androgen receptor negative human prostate
cancer cell line which is generally not tumorogenic
and does exhibit appreciable amounts of AGR2. Stable transfectants of DU145 cells were made with ectopic expression of AGR2 or green fluorescent protein
(GFP) as a control. In the DU145 cells, we observed
that increased expression of AGR2 resulted in a significant increase in CGA expression (Fig. 4, right panel). A similar pattern correlating AGR2 and NSE
expression was observed in PC3 and DU145 cells, but
was not as pronounced in 22RV1 cells. We conclude
that AGR2 expression generally correlates with CGA
and NSE expression in prostate cancer cell lines.

Fig. 4. CGA and NSE levels are modulated by AGR2. Prostate
cancer cell lines (22Rv1,PC3, and DU145) were transduced with lentiviral particles to knockdown AGR2 (shRNA in 22Rv1and PC3) or
induce overexpression (cDNA in DU145) as compared to control
(scrambled) or (GFP) vectors, respectively. AGR2, CGA, NSE, and
actin expressionin celllysates were determinedbyimmunoblot.

DISCUSSION
AGR2 is widely expressed in normal mucus-producing and endocrine-responsive cells in lung, stomach, colon, pancrease, breast, and prostate [7].
Microdissection studies show that AGR2 expression
is elevated in prostate carcinoma compared to adjacent normal tissue, and urine-based detection of
AGR2 has been proposed as a potential diagnostic
marker for prostate cancer [10]. Conflicting data exist
concerning the potential for tissue-based measurements of AGR2 levels to add to standard prognostic
markers used to risk-stratify patients with newly diagnosed prostate cancer [11,12]. Despite strong data
supporting a role for AGR2 in promoting a metastatic
phenotype in pre-clinical models, expression of AGR2
in metastatic prostate cancer has not been previously
explored [5].
Here, we utilized a combination of blood-based
approaches to evaluate AGR2 expression in patients
with metastatic prostate cancer. First, we used peripheral-blood RNA enriched for the presence of CTCs towards determining if AGR2 mRNA expression was
elevated in cancer cells in patients with metastatic
prostate cancer. We conclude that AGR2 is expressed
in metastatic prostate cancer as evidenced by finding
a significant correlation between CTC enumeration
and AGR2 mRNA expression. However, as CTCs are
not present in all patients and may not accurately reflect AGR2 expression in all tumor deposits, we utilized an AGR2 ELISA assay to quantify plasma AGR2
levels in patients with metastatic prostate cancer. We
find that plasma AGR2 levels are significantly elevated in patients with metastatic prostate cancer versus
normal male controls. Further, our preliminary results
show that plasma AGR2 levels can vary in response
to androgen-directed and other therapies used for
patients with metastatic prostate cancer. Finally, we
noted very high plasma AGR2 levels in patients with
a ‘‘neuroendocrine’’ or ‘‘anaplastic’’ variant of metastatic prostate cancer and suggest that AGR2 expression correlates with expression of neuroendocrine
markers (CGA and NSE) in prostate cancer cells.
Despite strong data implicating AGR2 expression
in a metastatic phenotype, a mechanistic connection
between AGR2 expression and metastatic progression
remains elusive. Persson et al. [3] have demonstrated
that AGR2 may be a novel type of the protein disulfide isomerase (PDI). Members of the PDI family have
roles associated with oxioreduction during protein
folding in the endoplasmic reticulum [35]. However,
the possible enzymatic effects or down-stream targets
of AGR2 expression or activation remains generally
unexplored. Induction of AGR2 levels in response to
steroid treatment in breast [36] and prostate [2] cancer
has been demonstrated. This would suggest that

increasing tissue expression of AGR2 should be correlated with PSA concentration. Our results do not support this hypothesis and instead indicate that
serological AGR2 and PSA are decoupled in prostate
cancer (Fig. 3). This is further supported by the inverse relationship between AGR2 and PSA levels in
NE-CRPC patients (Fig. 2).
NE-CRPC represents an extreme example of the
clinical situation where PSA levels are neither elevated nor useful as a therapeutic marker in metastatic prostate cancer. Areas of neuroendocrine
differentiation are commonly found in histologic
sections representing prostate adenocarcinoma,
however the clinical significance of these findings
remain controversial [37]. For patients with metastatic prostate cancer, a ‘‘neuroendocrine’’ or ‘‘anaplastic’’ phenotype has more recently started to be
defined in hopes of identifying patients who may
benefit from more intensive cytotoxic chemo-hormonal therapy [31,38]. While no clear consensus
definition has emerged for NE or ‘‘anaplastic’’
CRPC, clinical features used to define this entity
often include characteristics such as: (i) the presence of extensive visceral metastases; (ii) low PSA
values (typically <10 ng/ml); (iii) osteolytic bone
metastases; and (iv) a short duration of response to
ADT. Conventional plasma or serum markers often
elevated in NE-CRPC include CGA, NSE, and CEA
[28,39]. However, not all patients with NE-CRPC
can be identified, let alone followed with the available blood-based markers. Our data suggests that
plasma AGR2 levels may be used to help define
and potentially better direct treatment for NECRPC. A limitation of our study is that the clinical
association between elevated plasma AGR2 levels
and NE-CRPC is based on a small sub-sample
(n ¼ 3) of our overall cohort. Additional studies

Significant effort has been placed on the identification of biomarkers which would enable oncologists to
better understand prostate cancer progression. This is
especially important with patients with metastatic
prostate cancer, as PSA levels do not always correlate
with disease progression or therapeutic efficacy. In
fact, patients with anaplastic prostate cancer are characterized by low PSA levels and typically have poor
prognosis. In summary, we propose that plasma
AGR2 levels may be useful to help characterize, monitor, and direct therapies for patients with metastatic
prostate cancer. Additional research is needed to better understand potential mechanistic and prognostic
implications of AGR2 expression in relation to the underlying tumor biology and disease course in patients
with prostate cancer.
