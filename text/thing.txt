Abstract
Background: Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is an aggressive disease with variable clinical outcome,
accounting for at least 25-30 % of adult non-Hodgkin lymphomas. Approximately one third of DLBCL patients are
not cured by the currently used treatment regimen, R-CHOP. Hence, new treatment strategies are needed.
Antagonizing the CXCR4 receptor might be promising since the CXCR4-CXCL12 axis is implicated in several aspects
of tumor pathogenesis as well as in protection from chemotherapeutic response. In Burkitt lymphoma, the CXCR4
antagonist plerixafor has already been shown to enhance the therapeutic effect of rituximab, the
immunotherapeutic agent of R-CHOP; but this is yet to be confirmed for DLBCL. We, therefore, investigated the
effect of plerixafor on DLBCL cellular response to rituximab.
Methods: In this in vitro study, human DLBCL cell lines were treated with rituximab and/or plerixafor,
concomitantly or in sequence. The trypan blue exclusion method and MTS-based assays were used to evaluate
cellular proliferation, whereas flow cytometry was used for assessment of apoptosis status and CXCR4 surface
expression level. Linear mixed effects models were used to assess statistical significance.
Results: We observed that simultaneous addition of plerixafor and rituximab resulted in a significant decrease in
DLBCL cellular proliferation, compared to monotherapeutic response. The effect was dose-dependent, and
concomitant administration was observed to be superior to sequential drug administration. Accordingly, the
fraction of apoptotic/dead cells significantly increased following addition of plerixafor to rituximab treatment.
Furthermore, exposure of DLBCL cells to plerixafor resulted in a significant decrease in CXCR4 fluorescence intensity.
Conclusions: Based on our results, implying that the anti-proliferative/pro-apoptotic effect of rituximab on DLBCL
cells can be synergistically enhanced by the CXCR4 antagonist plerixafor, addition of plerixafor to the R-CHOP
regimen can be suggested to improve treatment outcome for DLBCL patients.

Background
Lymphomas are a class of hematological cancers which
can be categorized as either Hodgkin lymphomas or
non-Hodgkin lymphomas. Non-Hodgkin lymphomas are
the most frequent of the two, with the aggressive diffuse
large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) accounting for at least
25-30 % of adult non-Hodgkin lymphomas [1].
DLBCL is a clinically, morphologically, and molecu-
larly heterogeneous disease with an unknown etiology
[2]. The treatment currently used for DLBCL is a multi-
agent regimen combining the anti-CD20 monoclonal
antibody rituximab with three chemotherapeutic drugs,
i.e. cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, and vincristine, and
with the corticosteroid prednisone (R-CHOP). Addition
of rituximab to the treatment regimen of DLBCL pa-
tients has improved treatment outcome significantly [3–
6]. Even so, 30-40 % of DLBCL patients have refractory
disease or relapse after treatment with R-CHOP [7]. Re-
lapsed patients are generally treated with high-dose
chemotherapy in combination with autologous stem cell
transplantation. The majority of these patients are, how-
ever, not eligible for this treatment strategy because of
their age, comorbidities, or refractory disease. Thus, this
subset of patients is not cured and, consequently, other
therapeutic approaches are required.[8]
Rituximab is a genetically engineered chimeric mono-
clonal antibody consisting of a human Fc region and mur-
ine variable regions, recognizing CD20 cell surface
molecules abundantly present on most normal and malig-
nant B-cells [9]. Uncertainty remains on how rituximab
exerts its therapeutic effects. Several mechanisms have
been proposed, including complement-dependent cyto-
toxicity (CDC), antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity
(ADCC), and apoptosis. Interestingly, the effect of rituxi-
mab was enhanced by the C-X-C chemokine receptor type
4 (CXCR4) antagonist plerixafor (AMD3100) in a related
type of lymphoma (Burkitt lymphoma) [10, 11]. This
CXCR4 antagonist displays a low-risk safety profile and
has already been approved by the U.S Food and Drug Ad-
ministration (FDA) for clinical use in non-Hodgkin
lymphoma patients in combination with granulocyte
colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) for the purpose of mo-
bilizing hematopoietic stem cells [12]. Plerixafor is a spe-
cific small molecule CXCR4 inhibitor. More specifically,
plerixafor is a bicyclic reversible inhibitor that blocks
binding of the CXCR4 receptor ligand, C-X-C chemokine
ligand type 12 (CXCL12 or SDF-1α), by binding to an
extracellular binding pocket of CXCR4 [13].
CXCR4 is a cell surface receptor implicated in B-cell
lymphopoiesis, as demonstrated by severely impaired B-
cell lymphopoiesis in CXCR4-deficient mice [14, 15]. It
is expressed on normal and many malignant
hematopoietic cells; including those of non-Hodgkin
lymphomas, multiple myeloma, acute lymphoblastic
Page 2 of 12
leukemia (ALL), and chronic lymphocytic leukemia
(CLL) [16, 17]. Recently, CXCR4 overexpression was re-
ported to be associated with decreased survival of mice
intravenously injected with DLBCL cells [18] and, im-
portantly, with poor prognosis in a cohort of 94 DLBCL
patients treated with rituximab-containing regimens [18]
and a training/validation cohort of 468/275 DLBCL pa-
tients treated with the R-CHOP regimen [19].
The CXCR4-CXCL12 axis appears to be implicated in
several biological functions linked to tumor pathogen-
esis. Proliferative and pro-survival signaling pathways
can be induced by activation of CXCR4 on the surface of
tumor cells, and blocking the CXCR4 receptor, accord-
ingly, results in inhibition of tumor proliferation [11,
20]. Migration of CXCR4-positive hematopoietic cells is
promoted by a gradient generated through stromal cell
production of CXCL12 [16]. In line with this, blocking
CXCR4 results in inhibition of tumor metastasis [21].
Chemotherapy protection of malignant hematopoietic
cells is shown to be induced by interaction with sur-
rounding stromal cells in e.g. the bone marrow. Accord-
ingly, this interaction is suggested to be involved in
treatment resistance and persistence of minimal residual
disease.[22] By inhibiting the interaction of CXCR4 with
its ligand CXCL12, several studies have reported that the
tumor-promoting signals of stromal cells can be re-
versed, resulting in more chemotherapy-susceptible
tumor cells and an increase in the spontaneous apop-
tosis rate [23–26]. Consequently, blocking the CXCR4-
CXCL12 axis might be a promising approach for po-
tentiating the effects of the currently used treatment
regimen in DLBCL.
To the best of our knowledge, the effect of combining
the CXCR4 antagonist plerixafor with the monoclonal
anti-CD20 antibody rituximab has never been evaluated
in DLBCL; neither in vitro, nor in vivo. In this study, we
evaluated the in vitro effect of combining plerixafor and
rituximab, by comparing the level of growth inhibition
induced by single agent and combination treatment of
DLBCL cell lines. Flow cytometry-based assays were ap-
plied to DLBCL cell lines to investigate the combined
and solitary effect of the drugs on CXCR4 surface ex-
pression and on apoptosis stage. Thus, this study investi-
gates how rituximab and/or plerixafor influence CXCR4
expression, and how the expression of CXCR4 influences
drug effect in vitro.
Methods
Cell line characteristics
In this study, two human DLBCL-derived malignant sus-
pension cell lines were used; RIVA and FARAGE. Both
cell lines were kindly provided by Dr. Jose A. Martinez-
Climent (Molecular Oncology Laboratory, University of
Navarra, Pamplona, Spain). Through systematic dose-Reinholdt et al. Biomarker Research (2016) 4:12
response experiments, thoroughly described previously
[27], the 50 % growth inhibition (GI G
50 )-values of the cell
lines with respect to rituximab were determined to be
3.3 μg/mL and 27.8 μg/mL, respectively (Additional file 1),
demonstrating RIVA to be more sensitive than FARAGE.
This difference in rituximab sensitivity was our incentive to
proceed with these cell lines. In regards to molecular sub-
type, RIVA is ABC-like whereas FARAGE is classified as
GCB [28]. According to the Leibniz Institute DSMZ-
German Collection of Microorganisms and Cell Cultures
catalogue (ACC 585), RIVA displays a complex karyotype,
carrying i.a. MYC rearrangement (t(4;8)(q22;q24)) and
BCL2 amplification (der(18)amp(18)(q21)dup(18)(q21q23)).
According to the American Type Culture Collection
(ATCC CRL-2630), FARAGE has a more simple karyotype,
with trisomy of chromosome 11 as the only listed karyo-
typic aberration.
Cell culturing
Cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium (Life
Technologies, Copenhagen, DK) supplemented with
10 % heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen,
Copenhagen, DK), 100 U/mL penicillin, and 100 μg/mL
streptomycin (Life Technologies, Copenhagen, DK), at
37 °C and 5 % CO 2 in a humidified atmosphere. Cells
were passaged regularly to ensure optimal cell growth,
and maintained for a maximum of 25 passages to
minimize any long-term culturing effects. To ensure that
cells were harvested in their exponential growth phase
when conducting experiments, cells were incubated at
37 °C and 5 % CO 2 in a humidified atmosphere for ap-
proximately 24 h after seeding. Importantly, both cell
lines were identification-validated and examined for
mycoplasma infection at the end of their culturing
period, to avoid misinterpretation of the experiments
due to cross-contamination/mislabeling or mycoplasma-
induced changes of cellular properties, respectively. The
EZ-PCR Mycoplasma Test Kit (Biological Industries, Beit
HaEmek, IL) was used to test for presence of myco-
plasma. For identification validation (barcoding), DNA
was extracted using the DNeasy Blood and Tissue Kit
(Qiagen, Copenhagen, DK) and multiplex PCR per-
formed using the AmpFlSTR® Identifiler® PCR Amplifi-
cation Kit (Applied Biosystems, Copenhagen, DK).
Capillary electrophoresis was completed and analysis
performed using Osiris (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/
projects/SNP/osiris/). Cell line identity was determined
by comparing a selection of 9 short tandem repeats
against the Leibniz Institute DSMZ-German Collection
of Microorganisms and Cell Cultures database (http://
www.dsmz.de/services/services-human-and-animal-cell-
lines/online-str-analysis.html). Unless otherwise stated,
all reported incubation steps were performed at 37 °C in
a humidified atmosphere of 5 % CO 2 .

Administration of reagents
DLBCL cell lines were exposed to rituximab (MabThera®,
Roche, Copenhagen, DK) and/or plerixafor (InSolution TM
CXCR4 Antagonist I, AMD3100, Merck Millipore,
Copenhagen, DK), in sequence or concomitantly. By com-
bining rituximab and plerixafor, we expected a synergistic
therapeutic effect, allowing a dose reduction and, thereby,
reducing toxicity while maintaining efficacy and minimiz-
ing/delaying induction of drug resistance [29]. A final con-
centration of 20 % Pooled Human AB Serum (HS)
(Novakemi AB, Handen, SE) was added, as a source of
complement [30] and CXCL12 [31], in order to enable as-
sessment of rituximab-induced CDC and investigate the
impact of CXCR4 antagonism, using the same batch of
HS (IPLA-SERAB-13517) for all experiments to avoid
batch-induced variation. The end point of drug adminis-
tration was to measure cellular proliferation, apoptosis,
and CXCR4 cell surface expression. All reported concen-
trations are final concentrations.
Cell proliferation assays
Drug-induced growth inhibition of RIVA and FARAGE
cells was assessed in two ways, 1) through enumeration
of living cells using the trypan blue exclusion method, 2)
through an MTS-based assay.
For the trypan blue exclusion method, cells were
seeded out in 24-well culture plates at a concentration
of 0.3 × 10 6 cells/mL, 24 h before drug/saline and HS
was added. Rituximab (10 μg/mL) and plerixafor
(500 μM) was added either concomitantly or with a 24 h
time lag. Following a drug incubation period of 0 h,
24 h, or 72 h, homogenized single cell suspension and
trypan blue (Life Technologies, Copenhagen, DK) was
mixed 1:1, with inclusion of three counting replicates
per well. Cells were counted directly, using a
hemocytometer and a light microscope.
For MTS-based assays, cells were seeded out in 96-well
culture plates at a concentration of 0.3 × 10 6 cells/mL,
24 h before drug/saline was added. A 5-point 2-fold serial
dilution was applied in triplicates, each drug alone as well
as the two drugs combined (C1 + C1, C2 + C2, and so
forth). Rituximab in concentrations ranging from 4.17 μg/
mL to 66.67 μg/mL, and plerixafor from 208.33 μM to
3333.33 μM. After drug addition, plates were incubated
for 30 min before adding HS. After a 48 h incubation
period, the number of metabolically active cells was esti-
mated by adding the MTS-containing CellTiter 96® AQue-
ous One Solution Reagent (Promega, Madison, WI, USA)
at a concentration of 20 % of the pre-addition well con-
tent, incubating for exactly two hours, shaking for 10 s,
and finally measuring absorbance at 492 nm, using an
Optima-Fluostar plate reader (BMG LABTECH, Orten-
berg, DE). To avoid border effect, all border wells were
omitted from data analysis.Reinholdt et al. Biomarker Research (2016) 4:12
Flow cytometry-based analysis
CXCR4 cell surface expression level and apoptosis status
of RIVA and FARAGE cells was assessed concomitantly
by flow cytometry-based analysis. 24 h before administra-
tion of drug/saline, 600 μL cell suspension per well was
seeded out in 24-well culture plates at a concentration of
0.3 × 10 6 cells/mL. After administering rituximab (10 μg/
mL) and/or plerixafor (500 μM), plates were incubated for
30 min before addition of HS. Drug-exposed and un-
treated cells were harvested and stained following a 48 h
incubation period. The PE Annexin V Apoptosis Detec-
tion Kit I (BD Biosciences, Copenhagen, DK) was applied
as described by the manufacturer, with the following mod-
ifications. Cells were only washed once and in stain buffer,
after which they were resuspended in 100 μL 1X Binding
Buffer. Immediately prior to addition of 7-Amino-
Actinomycin (7-AAD) and PE-conjugated Annexin V
antibody, 10 μL APC-conjugated anti-CXCR4 antibody
(clone 12G5, BD Biosciences, Copenhagen, DK) was
added. Following incubation at room temperature in the
dark for 15 min, 100 μL 1X Binding Buffer was added to
each tube. Unstained cells as well as single staining with
the appropriate antibodies were included as controls. A
BD FACSCanto TM II (BD Biosciences, Copenhagen, DK)
was used for analysis, and data were analyzed using
FlowJo Software (Tree Star Inc., OR).
Statistical analysis
To evaluate significance between treatment groups, linear
mixed effects models were applied with experimental rep-
licate as random effect and either number of living cells,
fraction of apoptotic/dead cells, or log-transformed
CXCR4 expression values as dependent variable. To evalu-
ate the type of drug interaction (i.e. additive, antagonistic,
or synergistic), number of living cells was used as
dependent variable in a linear mixed effects model with
interaction between rituximab and plerixafor as independ-
ent variable and experimental replicate as random effect.
A significance level of 0.05 was applied, and statistical sig-
nificances between selected groups are indicated on the
figures. The treatment group without significance denota-
tion is the reference. All data analyses were performed
using the statistical software R, version 3.2.2.
Results
The CXCR4 antagonist plerixafor significantly enhanced
the rituximab-induced effect on growth inhibition of
diffuse large B-cell lymphoma cell lines
To determine if plerixafor modulates the effect of
rituximab-induced growth inhibition, RIVA and
FARAGE cells were treated with rituximab (10 μg/mL)
and/or plerixafor (500 μM) for up to 72 h, and the num-
ber of living cells was counted by the trypan blue exclu-
sion method, after 0 h, 24 h, and 72 h of drug exposure.
Page 4 of 12
For both cell lines, rituximab single agent treatment re-
sulted in a significant decrease in the number of living
cells after 24 h-72 h (p < 0.05), and plerixafor monother-
apy in a significant decrease after 72 h (p < 0.05) (Fig. 1).
Remarkably, by administering plerixafor and rituximab
concomitantly, a pronounced reduction (p < 0.001) in the
number of living cells, as compared to both the untreated
control and single agent treatments, was observed after
24 h-72 h for RIVA (Fig. 1a) and 72 h for FARAGE
(Fig. 1b). To evaluate the type of drug interaction, linear
mixed effects models with interaction between rituximab
and plerixafor were applied, revealing that a synergistic
interaction can be assumed at 24 h-72 h for RIVA (p <
0.001) and 72 h for FARAGE (p < 0.01).
For investigating if drug combination sequence has
impact on outcome, drugs were added sequentially with
a 24 h gap, in addition to the single agent treatments
and the concomitant administration. For both cell lines,
the most pronounced effect was observed following con-
comitant treatment (Fig. 1). By adding rituximab and
plerixafor sequentially, the decrease in the number of
living cells was significantly smaller for both cell lines,
compared to concomitant exposure for 72 h (p < 0.001).
Results were especially pronounced for RIVA, the more
rituximab-sensitive cell line. Concomitant administration
resulted in a 4-fold reduction in the number of living
cells as compared to the untreated control, whereas ini-
tial administration of rituximab followed by plerixafor
24 h later only caused a 1.8-fold reduction (Fig. 1a).
Therefore, we conclude that combination sequence of ri-
tuximab and plerixafor is of importance, with concomi-
tant administration being superior to sequential
administration. Hence, concomitant drug administration
was included in subsequent experiments.
MTS-based assays were performed to further investi-
gate the effect of adding plerixafor to rituximab treat-
ment of DLBCL cells. A 5-point 2-fold serial dilution
(rituximab: 4.17-66.67 μg/mL; plerixafor: 208.33-
3333.33 μM) was applied to RIVA and FARAGE cells,
alone as well as in combination, 48 h before addition of
an MTS-containing reagent, with absorbance readings at
492 nm 2 h later. For both cell lines, rituximab mono-
therapy resulted in a reduction in the number of meta-
bolically active cells, as compared to the untreated
control, for all concentrations tested (Fig. 2). Plerixafor
monotherapy, on the contrary, showed only little to no
effect at low concentrations, whereas the reduction in
the number of metabolically active cells was very pro-
nounced at the highest concentration tested, as com-
pared to the untreated control (Fig. 2). Whether the
effect of high plerixafor concentration is due to general
cytotoxicity remains to be tested, however. The drug-
induced response pattern was very similar between the
two cell lines, with optimal treatment choice dependingReinholdt et al. Biomarker Research (2016) 4:12

Fig. 1 The growth-inhibitory effect of rituximab was significantly enhanced by plerixafor, in a drug sequence-dependent manner. The diffuse large B-

or the CXCR4 antagonist plerixafor (500 μM) as well as to combination treatment, either concomitantly or with a 24 h time lag. The number of living

Fig. 2 The growth-inhibitory effect of rituximab was remarkably enhanced by plerixafor, in a drug concentration-dependent manner. The diffuse large
B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) cell lines RIVA (a) and FARAGE (b) were exposed to a two-fold serial dilution of the anti-CD20 antibody rituximab (4.17-
66.67 μg/mL) and/or the CXCR4 antagonist plerixafor (208.33-3333.33 μM) for 48 h. When in combination, corresponding concentrations of the drugs
were administered (i.e. C1 + C1, C2 + C2, and so forth). Blank-corrected absorbance values were obtained through MTS-based experiments. Data are
presented as mean of a minimum of three technical replicates, with each individual replicate presented as a geometric symbol. PLX, plerixafor;

on the drug concentrations used. For the majority of
concentrations (C3-C5) applied to the two cell lines,
combined treatment exceeded the effect induced by the
corresponding concentration of rituximab (Fig. 2). The
effect of single agent treatment with plerixafor was
exceeded by combined treatment for all concentrations
tested; except for the highest concentration where no
evident difference was observed (Fig. 2).
In conclusion, we observed that the growth-inhibitory
effect of rituximab can be enhanced by the CXCR4 an-
tagonist plerixafor in DLBCL cell lines, presumably in a
synergistic manner, with a more pronounced effect for
cells displaying higher rituximab sensitivity. Further-
more, we demonstrated that the effect of combination
treatment is dose-dependent as well as drug sequence-
dependent, with concomitant administration being su-
perior to sequential administration.
Combining plerixafor with rituximab significantly
increased the fraction of apoptotic/dead diffuse large B-
cell lymphoma cells
To explore the mechanism of drug effect in RIVA and
FARAGE cells, rituximab (10 μg/mL) and/or plerixafor
(500 μM) were applied and apoptosis analysis performed
48 h later by flow cytometry, using 7-AAD in combin-
ation with Annexin V to distinguish living cells (7-AAD
−
/Annexin V − ), early apoptotic cells (7-AAD − /Annexin
V + ), and late apoptotic/dead cells (7-AAD + /Annexin V + )
from each other.
In accordance with the proliferation experiment results,
administering plerixafor concomitantly with rituximab sig-
nificantly increased the fraction of early apoptotic (p <
0.001) as well as late apoptotic/dead cells (p < 0.05), relative
to single agent treatments (Fig. 3), indicating apoptosis to
be part of the drug response mechanism. As for the prolif-
eration experiments, the effect of combination treatment
on apoptosis status was not as pronounced for the less
rituximab-sensitive FARAGE cells (Fig. 3c).
In conclusion, the fraction of DLBCL cells in early as
well as late apoptosis was significantly increased when
plerixafor was administered simultaneously with rituxi-
mab, as compared to single agent treatments.
Plerixafor induced a significant decrease in CXCR4
fluorescence intensity for diffuse large B-cell lymphoma
cell lines
Since a post-treatment decrease in bone marrow-
expressed CXCR4 was recently reported to be associated
with favorable treatment response and significantly better
prognosis in a small cohort of non-Hodgkin lymphoma
patients [32], we wanted to investigate the effect of plerix-
afor (500 μM) and/or rituximab (10 μg/mL) on the cell
surface expression level of CXCR4. This was conducted
48 h post-drug addition by flow cytometry-based analysis
Page 6 of 12
of RIVA and FARAGE cells. A significant decrease in me-
dian CXCR4 fluorescence intensity following plerixafor
monotherapy was observed for both cell lines, relative to
untreated control (p < 0.001) (Fig. 4), with the decrease be-
ing especially pronounced for the more rituximab-
sensitive RIVA cells (Fig. 4a). The plerixafor-induced de-
crease was not significantly affected by concomitant treat-
ment with rituximab (p > 0.05) (Fig. 4).
In conclusion, plerixafor induced a reduction in me-
dian CXCR4 fluorescence intensity, which was not sig-
nificantly altered when rituximab was included in the
treatment of DLBCL cells.
Discussion
CXCR4 is an interesting target in DLBCL since overex-
pression of this receptor has recently been associated
with poor prognosis in a cohort of R-CHOP-treated
DLBCL patients [19]. Notably, CXCR4 antagonists can
be used as potential drug sensitizers since treatment-
induced CXCL12 pathway activation might be involved
in acquired drug-resistance mechanisms through several
processes, including induction of cancer cell survival, in-
vasion, and stem cell phenotype [33].
In this in vitro study on DLBCL cell lines, we investi-
gated the effect of adding the CXCR4 antagonist plerixa-
for to the anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody rituximab, an
immunotherapeutic compound already included in the
standard treatment regimen of DLBCL. The effect of
plerixafor on the rituximab-induced decrease in the
number of proliferating tumor cells was found to be
dependent on drug concentration; but for the majority
of concentrations tested, plerixafor significantly en-
hanced the effect of rituximab (Fig. 2). When examining
the interaction between rituximab and plerixafor, it was
confirmed that a synergistic interaction can be assumed.
This might very well be valid in vivo as well. Hu et al.
[11] showed that the therapeutic efficacy of rituximab, as
measured by median survival time, was enhanced by
plerixafor in a disseminated Burkitt lymphoma model;
and although O’Callaghan et al. [10] did not find plerix-
afor to have an effect on survival of Burkitt lymphoma
cells in vitro, neither when used as single agent treat-
ment nor when in combination with rituximab, they
found that combining plerixafor with rituximab in vivo
resulted in a significant increase in survival of mice with
disseminated Burkitt lymphoma, compared to single
agent treatment with rituximab, suggesting a substantial
clinical effect of combining the two drugs. The much
lower dose of plerixafor (10 μM) used by O’Callaghan et
al. could very likely explain the lack of in vitro effect; at
low doses we did not observe any effect of plerixafor ei-
ther (Fig. 2).
The enhancing effect of CXCR4 antagonism on rituxi-
mab efficacy is not limited to plerixafor, however. In aReinholdt et al. Biomarker Research (2016) 4:12

recent study by Beider et al. [34], addition of the CXCR4
antagonist BKT140 to rituximab treatment was demon-
strated to significantly decrease the number of viable
lymphoma cells in Burkitt lymphoma cell line studies as
well as in the bone marrow of mice with disseminated
Burkitt lymphoma xenografts. Another way of targeting
CXCR4 is through pepducins, which are cell-penetrating
lipopeptide CXCR4 antagonists. O’Callaghan et al. [10]
observed a significant increase in the rituximab-induced
apoptotic effect on Burkitt lymphoma cell lines and pri-
mary CLL cells, when combined with the CXCR4 antag-
onizing pepducins; a treatment strategy which was also
capable of increasing the survival of mice with dissemi-
nated Burkitt lymphoma xenografts, compared to treat-
ing with rituximab alone.
In addition to boosting the effect of rituximab, CXCR4
inhibition has been shown to enhance the effect of other
components of the R-CHOP regimen. Lee et al. [35] ex-
plored the effect of the CXCR4 antagonist T22 on the in
vivo efficacy of cyclophosphamide in the treatment of
established lung metastases from melanoma cells, show-
ing a synergistic drug interaction. In ALL, plerixafor has
been shown to enhance vincristine efficacy in vitro [36]
and in vivo [37] and, interestingly, survival of ALL-
engrafted mice was extended when plerixafor was added
to vincristine treatment [37]. Plerixafor can also sensitize
tumor cells to doxorubicin. In an in vitro study con-
ducted by Azab et al. [23], multiple myeloma cells were
demonstrated to be more sensitive to doxorubicin when
tumor cell interaction with bone marrow stromal cells
was interrupted by plerixafor. These observations sug-
gest that CXCR4 antagonists might exert an even more
beneficial effect when combined with the complete R-
CHOP regimen, yielding CXCR4 inhibition a promising
supplement to the already-implemented R-CHOP treat-
ment in DLBCL.
A phase I clinical trial (NCT00694590) in 24
previously-treated, but relapsed, CLL or small lympho-
cytic lymphoma (SLL) patients has been conducted with
the purpose of investigating if plerixafor sensitizes tumor
cells to rituximab-induced killing. The focus was to
monitor the safety and efficacy of adding plerixafor to
the standard treatment with rituximab, with the primary
objective of determining the maximum tolerated plerixa-
for dose in combination treatment. According to the ab-
stract by Andritsos et al. [38], presenting preliminary
results for the CLL patients and testing a maximum
plerixafor concentration of 0.32 mg/kg, the combined
treatment was well-tolerated and, in a proportion of pa-
tients, partial remission was observed. Hopefully, this
will lead to further clinical examination of plerixafor in
combination with R-CHOP.
The primarily used plerixafor concentration in our
studies is quite high (500 μM); however, at this concen-
tration, a synergistic effect with rituximab can be as-
sumed whereas single agent plerixafor treatment does
not appear to be toxic to the lymphoma cells (Fig. 1).
For healthy human volunteers treated with 0.32 mg/kg
subcutaneously administered plerixafor, a maximum
plasma concentration of 1000 μg/L was estimated (~ ap-
proximately 2 μM) [39]. For comparison, a dosage of
0.24 mg/kg (injected subcutaneously) is recommended
for hematopoietic stem cell mobilization and subsequent
autologous transplantation. Thus, our results indicate
that in order for a synergistic effect to occur, it might be
necessary to raise the concentration of plerixafor used inReinholdt et al. Biomarker Research (2016) 4:12
a clinical setting, receiving higher concentrations than
those measured in the blood of individuals treated with
plerixafor. However, many factors are at play in the more
complex clinical setting and could influence drug inter-
action and, thus, concentration needed for synergistic
effect.
In the present study, we observed that concomitant ad-
ministration of plerixafor and rituximab is of great import-
ance (Fig. 1); an observation especially relevant if
plerixafor is to be tested for inclusion into the DLBCL
treatment regimen. In support of this observation, Kozin
et al. [40] demonstrated that concomitant treatment was
superior to sequential drug administration, showing that
treatment with plerixafor immediately after local irradi-
ation in breast and lung carcinoma murine xenograft
models resulted in significant inhibition of tumor re-
growth, whereas administration of plerixafor 5 days post-
irradiation treatment rendered plerixafor without effect.
When exploring the mechanism of drug effect, we ob-
served that the fraction of apoptotic cells increased upon
combined treatment with rituximab and plerixafor
(Fig. 3). This implies that apoptosis induction is a con-
tributing factor to the enhanced effect observed when
subjecting DLBCL cells to plerixafor in combination
with rituximab. In accordance, Beider et al. [34] ob-
served the CXCR4 antagonist BKT140 to reverse
rituximab-induced cellular arrest of Burkitt lymphoma
cells, demonstrating that the number of late apoptotic/
dead cells increased significantly upon combination
treatment, with increased activation of the apoptotic cas-
pase3 pathway.
The therapeutic effect of plerixafor is likely two-fold;
in addition to its direct sensitizing properties, plerixafor
might render CXCR4-expressing tumor cells more ac-
cessible to rituximab-induced eradication by inhibiting
tumor cell homing to the bone marrow and by mobiliz-
ing tumor cells to the peripheral blood [41, 42]. In line
with this, Beider et al. [34] observed that the survival
and proliferation of CXCR4-expressing tumor cells were
supported by the stroma and that this bone marrow
stromal cell-induced protection of Burkitt lymphoma
cells could be reversed by the CXCR4 antagonist
BKT140, increasing rituximab-induced tumor cell death.
Accordingly, Buchner et al. [43] demonstrated that
CXCR4 antagonists abrogate the stromal cell-induced
protection of CLL cells and, thereby, increase the effi-
cacy of rituximab-induced CDC.
Recently, it was reported that non-Hodgkin lymphoma
patients experiencing a decrease in bone marrow-
expressed CXCR4 after treatment, responded well and
had a significantly better prognosis [32]. Hence, we in-
vestigated the drug-induced effect on CXCR4 surface ex-
pression level, and found plerixafor to induce a decrease
in CXCR4 fluorescence intensity, as measured by flow
Page 9 of 12
cytometry (Fig. 4). This could either indicate plerixafor-
induced internalization of CXCR4 or masking of the re-
ceptor due to plerixafor binding; but in either case, it in-
dicates that plerixafor decreases CXCR4 receptor
accessibility. Consequently, our observation that com-
bined treatment is more effective in the RIVA cell line
might not only be due to the higher rituximab sensitivity
of this cell line, but also that more plerixafor molecules
have bound to RIVA cells and/or that plerixafor induces
a greater downregulation of CXCR4 on the surface of
RIVA cells. Kim et al. [44] and Moreno et al. [18] sug-
gest plerixafor treatment to cause internalization of mye-
loma and DLBCL cell surface-located CXCR4,
respectively, as assessed by flow cytometry; whereas
Fricker et al. [45] used flow cytometry-based assessment
of anti-CXCR4 antibody binding as an indirect measure
for binding of plerixafor to CXCR4. Also using flow cy-
tometry, Schols et al. [46] more thoroughly investigated
the interaction between plerixafor, anti-CXCR4 antibody,
and the CXCR4 receptor, in T-cell lymphoblastic lymph-
oma cells. They report that binding of plerixafor to the
CXCR4 receptor inhibits anti-CXCR4 antibody binding
and declare that CXCR4 internalization does not occur,
which they later confirmed by fluorescence microscopy-
based visualization using stably transfected U87.CD4
cells expressing GFP-coupled CXCR4 [47]. Hence, the
plerixafor-induced decrease in CXCR4 fluorescence in-
tensity observed in our study is most likely a measure of
receptor-bound plerixafor and not due to receptor in-
ternalization. Of notice, Beider et al. [34] observed that
Burkitt lymphoma cell interaction with bone marrow
stromal cells increased the tumor cell surface expression
of CXCR4. Thus, the effect of plerixafor on the amount
of available tumor cell CXCR4 receptors is probably
both direct via receptor blockade and indirect via dis-
ruption of tumor-stroma cell interaction, preventing the
stroma-induced increase in CXCR4 expression.
Patients diagnosed with ABC-DLBCL have a dismal
prognosis [48]. A frequent characteristic of ABC-DLBCL
is constitutive activation of the NF-kB signaling pathway
due to gain/loss-of-function mutations in genes encod-
ing pathway members upstream of the central transcrip-
tion factor NF-kB [49]. Of notice, NF-kB can induce
transcription of CXCR4, and CXCR4 pathway activity
can result in nuclear accumulation of NF-kB [50, 51].
Accordingly, Chen et al. discovered an association be-
tween high CXCR4 expression level and ABC subtype
[19], while Shin et al. reports high NF-kB expression in
DLBCL samples to associate with CXCR4 expression
[52]. By disrupting the positive feedback loop between
CXCR4 and NF-kB, the CXCR4 antagonist plerixafor
could possibly counterbalance the NF-kB signaling path-
way deregulation. In support, Huang et al. observed that
pre-treatment of osteosarcoma cells with plerixaforReinholdt et al. Biomarker Research (2016) 4:12
attenuated the CXCL12-induced increase in NF-kB pro-
moter activity [53], with similar results reported for oral
squamous cell carcinoma [54].
Like the ABC-DLBCL-diagnosed patients, double-hit
lymphoma patients have a poor outcome [55]. Most
commonly, double-hit lymphoma cases are of the GCB
subtype and characterized by concurrent chromosomal
translocations of MYC and BCL2, resulting in deregula-
tion of these oncogenes and, consequently, in deregula-
tion of the cell cycle process and apoptosis [56, 57].
Cancer cells of patients diagnosed with GCB-DLBCL are
frequently addicted to PI3K/Akt signaling, and degrad-
ation of Myc can be inhibited as a consequence of Akt-
induced inactivation of GSK-3β, whereas sequestering of
Bcl-2 can be disrupted by Akt-induced phosphorylation
of the proapoptotic protein Bad [49, 58, 59]. Since the
PI3K/Akt signaling pathway is central to CXCR4 signal-
ing [51], plerixafor could possibly attenuate the
translocation-induced deregulation of MYC and BCL2.
In agreement, Chen et al. observed an association be-
tween CXCR4-positivity of DLBCL tumor samples and
high expression of MYC as well as BCL2 [19]; whereas
Hatano et al [60] demonstrated decreased c-Myc expres-
sion and Mao et al. [61] decreased Bcl-2 expression
upon plerixafor administration, though in prostate can-
cer cells and brain tissue, respectively. Thus, plerixafor
additionally has potential as adjuvant therapy for
double-hit lymphoma patients.
Conclusions
Based on the promising findings of this study, implying that
the CXCR4 antagonist plerixafor synergistically enhances
the anti-proliferative/pro-apoptotic effect of rituximab on
DLBCL cells, it seems interesting to further explore the ef-
fect of combining rituximab with CXCR4 antagonism. If
our findings are reproducible in a clinical setting, adding
plerixafor to the R-CHOP regimen could result in reduced
development of drug resistance and, ultimately, in im-
proved patient survival; by combining synergistically inter-
acting drugs, the therapeutic effect might be either
increased, or maintained while lowering drug-induced tox-
icity by administering lower doses of the drugs [29].
