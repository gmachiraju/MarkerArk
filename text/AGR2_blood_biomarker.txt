BACKGROUND. Anterior gradient 2 (AGR2) is associated with metastatic progression in
prostate cancer cells as well as other normal and malignant tissues. We investigated AGR2
expression in patients with metastatic prostate cancer.
METHODS. Blood was collected from 44 patients with metastatic prostate cancer separated
as: castration sensitive prostate cancer (CSPC, n  5); castration resistant prostate cancer
(CRPC, n  36); and neuroendocrine-predominate CRPC defined by PSA  1 ng/ml in the
presence of wide-spread metastatic disease (NE-CRPC, n  3). AGR2 mRNA levels were
measured with RT-PCR in circulating tumor cell (CTC)-enriched peripheral blood. Plasma
AGR2 levels were determined via ELISA assay. AGR2 expression was modulated in prostate
cancer cell lines using plasmid and viral vectors.
RESULTS. AGR2 mRNA levels are elevated in CTCs and strongly correlated with CTC enumeration. Plasma AGR2 levels are elevated in all sub-groups. AGR2 levels vary independently to PSA and change in some patients in response to androgen-directed and other therapies.
Plasma AGR2 levels are highest in the NE-CRPC sub-group. A correlation between AGR2,
chromagranin A (CGA), and neuron-specific enolase (NSE) expression is demonstrated in
prostate cancer cell lines.
CONCLUSIONS. We conclude that AGR2 expression is elevated at the mRNA and protein
level in patients with metastatic prostate cancer. In particular, we find that AGR2 expression
is associated features consistent with neuroendocrine, or anaplastic, prostate cancer, exemplified by an aggressive clinical phenotype without elevation in circulating PSA levels. Further
studies are warranted to explore the mechanistic and prognostic implications of AGR2
expression in this patient population. Prostate # 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

INTRODUCTION
Prostate cancer is a common disease affecting men
in the U.S. with a projected incidence of over 200,000
cases in 2010 [1]. Most patients are diagnosed with
localized prostate cancer which is effectively treated
with surgery, radiation, or active surveillance. For
others, prostate cancer recurs despite primary therapy. The mainstay of therapy for recurrent or metastatic prostate cancer is androgen-deprivation therapy.
While most patients initially respond to androgen
withdrawal (castration sensitive prostate cancer,
CSPC), clinical advancement despite low levels of

circulating androgens signals progression to castration resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) which is associated with the majority of the prostate cancer related
morbidity and mortality.
Anterior gradient 2 (AGR2) is a member of the
protein disulfide isomerase (PDI) family which is
expressed in a variety of normal and transformed
epithelial tissues [2,3]. Pre-clinical studies have
shown that AGR2 expression is associated with increased cell migration and metastatic behavior in a
variety of tumor models [47]. Other studies show
that AGR2 expression is modulated by androgens
through ErbB3 binding protein 1 and Fox A transcription factors and confirm an association with a
more metastatic phenotype [2,8]. AGR2 expression
has also been associated with docetaxel-resistance
in the neuroendocrine-like PC3 prostate cancer cell
line in vitro [9]. AGR2 is known to be expressed in
primary prostate cancer tissues, and AGR2 levels
have been explored as a potential urine-based diagnostic marker for prostate cancer [2,10]. At the tissue level, changes in AGR2 expression in primary
prostate cancer tissue have been associated with either increased [11] or decreased [12] rates of clinical progression. To our knowledge, no studies have
examined expression of AGR2 in blood or tissue in
patients with metastatic prostate cancer.
Access to metastatic prostate cancer tissue for molecular characterization is very limited. Metastatic
prostate cancer generally develops over many years,
and after many therapies from the time diagnostic tissues are usually available. Genetic and other molecular abnormalities present in CRPC may not reflect
abnormalities present in an initial diagnostic biopsy
obtained many years or even decades earlier. Even if
tumor tissue could be directly sampled in the setting
of metastatic CRPC, autopsy data highlights the tremendous intra-individual variation in biomarker expression across metastatic tumors sites [13].
Examination of markers in peripheral blood represents a strategy to obtain a more complete representation of all tumors present in an individual.
Circulating tumor cells (CTCs) have been identified in the peripheral blood of cancer patients using a
variety of purification and detection techniques
[14,15]. The CellSearch system is the first system to
receive marketing approval by the US FDA for CTC
enumeration as a prognostic marker in patients with
metastatic breast, colorectal, and prostate cancer. We
have demonstrated that CTC-enriched blood contains
androgen receptor mutation profiles similar to those
found in metastatic prostate cancer deposits [16]. Other studies have also used the CellSearch system to
study gene and protein level changes from patients
with metastatic breast and prostate cancer [1722].
The Prostate

Plasma AGR2 levels have been found to be elevated
patients with ovarian and pancreatic cancer [23,24].
Taken together, these studies support our efforts to
apply blood-based assays to examine AGR2 expression in patients with metastatic prostate cancer.
MATERIALS ANDMETHODS
Eligibility and Blood Collection
Patients with histologically diagnosed adenocarcinoma of the prostate with metastatic disease demonstrated by routine clinical imaging studies were
approached for participation in a correlative study.
Blood collection included an ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) tube processed and stored for
plasma. In most cases, parallel tubes (CellSave and
CTC profile tubes for CellSearch) were also collected
and processed for CTC enumeration and RNA isolation, respectively, as previously described [16,21,22].
All blood was collected with informed consent of subjects under an Institution Review Board approved
protocol at all participating institutions. Control plasma from normal male subjects (age >50 years old)
was purchased from Bioreclamation, LLC (Westbury,
NY).
Enzyme-Linked Immuno-Assay (ELISA)
AGR2 protein levels were quantitatively assessed
by a commercial ELISA kit purchased from Uscn Lifesciences, Wahun, China. All samples were maintained
at 808C. Plasma was allowed to thaw on ice,
inverted several times, and centrifuged for 1 min at
200g prior to immuno-assay. Sample location on the
96-well plate were randomized in order to eliminate
plate bias. Each sample was analyzed at multiple
dilutions. The final AGR2 concentration was obtained
based on the dilution which corresponded to the linear portion of the standard curve.
The AGR2 ELISA was performed according to
manufacturers instructions. Briefly, 100 ml of each
sample (diluted with standard diluents provided by
Uscn) was added to each well and incubated overnight at 48C while rocking. Samples were aspirated
and 100 ml of detection reagent A was added to each
well and incubated for 1 hr at 378C. Each well was
aspirated and washed three times with wash buffer
(Uscn). One hundred microliters of detection reagent
B was added to each well and incubated for 30 min at
378C. Samples were aspirated and washed five times.
Ninety microliters of the substrate solution was
added to each well and incubated for 20 min at 378C
in the dark. Fifty microliters of the stop solution was
added to each well and OD at 450 nm was measured.
The ELISA kit for CGA was obtained from Abnova

AGR2 is a Biomarker of Metastatic Prostate Cancer
(Walnut, CA) and performed according to manufacturers instructions. The normal plasma CGA range
for this assay is <100 ng/ml according to the
manufacturer.
CirculatingTumor Cell (CTC) Enumeration
Seven and a half milliliters of blood for CTC enumeration was drawn into CellSave preservative tubes.
Samples were processed using the CellSearch Epithelial Cell Kit (Veridex, LLC; Raritan, NJ) and CTC
counts determined on the CellTracks Analyzer (Veridex, LLC) according to manufacturers instructions.
mRNAIsolation and AGR2 Expression
For gene expression studies, 7.5 ml of blood was
drawn into EDTA tubes and processed for CTCs
using the CellSearch Profile Kit (Veridex LLC) followed by RNA isolation basically as previously described [16,21,22]. Briefly, RNA isolation was
performed with the AllPrep DNA/RNA Micro Kit
(Qiagen; Valencia, CA) according to manufacturers
instructions. The turnaround time was no more than
36 hr from the blood draw to CTC enrichment and
nucleic acid isolation. RNA quality and quantity were
assessed with the Agilent Bioanalyzer. All samples
were stored at 808C until further use. First strand
cDNA was synthesized from equal amounts of template RNA from CTC-enriched peripheral blood using
a High Capacity cDNA archive kit then amplified
with the ABI TaqManPreAmp method (Applied Biosystems), which has been shown to reliably and reproducibly amplify mRNA for expression analysis
from a single cell [21]. Absolute AGR2 mRNA expression levels were quantified based on the CT computed
on the ABI7900 system (Applied Biosystems, Foster
City, CA). The probe sets and conditions were provided by the manufacturer for AGR2 (ABI Assay on demand Probe set: Hs00180702_m1), as described
previously [22]. The minimal detection limit was considered to be 40 cycles.CTC-enriched RNA samples
from 26 normal individuals were also run as controls.
Cell Culture and Materials
22Rv1, DU145, and PC3 cells were obtained from
the ATCC (Manassas, VA) and were cultured in
RPMI (22Rv1), DMEM (DU145), and F12K (PC3)
containing 10% FBS. AGR2 cDNA and GFP cDNA
were purchased from Origene (Rockville, MD) and
cloned into the pLVX-cmv-IRES-neo vector purchased
from Clonetech (Mountain View, CA). Lentiviral
particles containing sequences targeting 30 UTR of
AGR2 (CCGGCCTTGAGACTTGAAACCAGAACTCGAGTTCTGGTTTCAAGTCTCAAGGTTTTTTG) and

3

scrambled shRNA were purchased from Sigma
Aldrich (St. Louis, MO).
Immunoblotting
Prostate cancer cell lines were used to study
effects of altered AGR2 levels in prostate cancer
models as previously described [25]. Stable cell
lines were produced via transfection or lentiviral
infection according to manufacturers instructions,
and cell population with altered level of AGR2 expression were obtained following G418 selection
(Gemini Biosciences, West Sacramento, CA). Cells
were grown in 10 cm plates until 7585% confluent
and lysed with RIPA buffer, homogenized with a
28 gauged syringe, centrifuged at 14,000g for
10 minutes. Equal mass of protein lysates was determined by use of Bradford Assay (ThermoScientific, Rockford, IL). Lysates were loaded on a
420% acrylamide gel (ThermoScientific) and transferred to nitrocellulose membrane. Antibodies directed to AGR2 (Abnova, Walnut, CA), CGA
(SigmaAldrich), NSE (Dako USA, Carptenteria,
CA), and actin (SigmaAldrich, St. Louis, MO)
were used according to manufacturers directions.
Statistical Analysis
AGR2 levels of serum samples were assessed by
arithmetic average of measurements across dilutions
in which all values were in the linear calibration range
and not determined to be outliers. Measurement outliers were detected using either DFFITS >1 in estimating the logarithmic mean value [26] (for n  5
replicates) or a value deviating by more than a factor
of two from the average of the other replicates (for
n < 5 replicates, at most one outlier declared per sample); of 316 measurements, 16 outliers (5%) were
detected and removed. Parametric testing for significant differences in serum AGR2 between metastatic
prostate cancer cohorts and normal controls was performed using ANOVA followed by Dunnetts multiple comparison adjustment; a logarithmic variance
normalizing transform was applied prior to significance testing. To accommodate unequal group variances, parametric testing for significant differences in
serum CGA was performed using Welchs t-test on
logarithm-transformed data followed by Bonferroni
correction for multiple comparisons. Relative longitudinal values of AGR2 and corresponding 95% confidence intervals were estimated by applying a
categorical fixed effects model for logarithmic AGR2
level which included the time point (T0, T1, T2) as a
nested factor within the clinical subject factor. All statistical analyses were performed using R version
2.14.0 (www.r-project.org).

RESULTS
Demographics

Patients with metastatic prostate cancer generally
exhibit a predictable natural history marked by initial
sensitivity to androgen deprivation (castrate sensitive
prostate cancer, CSPC) followed by eventual progression in a subset of patients to an androgen-independent state (castrate-resistant prostate cancer, CRPC)
[27]. A particularly aggressive variant of metastatic
prostate cancer has been described based on the presence of neuroendocrine markers in blood and tissue
in association with a conventional adenocarcinoma
pattern. Features associated with neuroendocrineCRPC (NE-CRPC), or anaplastic prostate cancer, include as a usual pattern of early, visceral metastatic
spread as well as relatively low levels of serum PSA
[28]. Here we conservatively define NE-CRPC based
on the presence of wide-spread metastatic deposits
(bone, visceral, or both) along with a PSA value
1.0 ng/ml. Therefore, we divide our cohort of metastatic prostate cancer patients into three groups as
CSPC, CRPC, and NE-CRPC.
Baseline demographic characteristics of all 44 subjects with metastatic prostate cancer are summarized
in Table I. In the five subjects with CSPC, the median
(range) age and serum PSA were 58.1 (51.166.6)
years and 428.6 (2.47,606) ng/ml, respectively. Four
of five patients with CSPC had bone metastases (80%)
while one subject had metastatic disease only in
lymph nodes (20%). In 36 subjects with CRPC, the median (range) for age, serum PSA, and duration of androgen-deprivation therapy (ADT) was 69.4 (57.5
87.7) years, 150 (3.62403) ng/ml, and 37.2(5.2174.2)
months, respectively. For patients with imaging studies evaluable within 2 months of study enrollment,
the extent of metastatic disease in these patients was
typical for this population, as 94% (n  33) subjects
had bone metastases and 29% (n  28) had lymph

node or visceral metastases. Finally, for the three subjects with NE-CRPC, the age, serum PSA, and duration of ADT were 70.7 (68.179.2) years, PSA 0.4
(0.10.7) ng/ml, and 33.5 (5.2174.2) months, respectively. Consistent with the typical presentation for
NE-CRPC, the distribution of metastatic involvement
was distinct from CRPC such that all patients had
extensive lymph node and visceral metastases in
addition to extensive bone metastases (Table II).
AGR2 mRNA is Expressedin CRPC
Since AGR2 has been found to promote metastatic
progression in prostate and other cancer models,
we sought to determine if AGR2 was expressed in
tissue from patients with metastatic prostate cancer.
However, as metastatic tissue is often not available in
patients with CRPC, we evaluated AGR2 mRNA
expression in CTCs. The feasibility of gene-specific
expression analysis based on RNA obtained from
CTC-enriched peripheral blood has been previously
demonstrated [17,2022,29]. Here we utilized this basic
approach to examine if AGR2 mRNA was expressed
in CTCs in patients with metastatic prostate cancer.
Paired blood samples for CTC enumeration along
with isolation of CTC-enriched peripheral blood RNA
was available from a subset of the overall patient cohort. Specifically 49 samples were identified with 1
CTC/7.5 ml from patients with CRPC (n  30), CSPC
(n  2), or NE-CRPC (n  2). AGR2 mRNA levels,
expressed as average CT  SD, were significantly elevated in samples from patients with metastatic prostate cancer (CT  33.5  5.4) versus 26 samples
representing normal controls (CT  37.6  3.7)
(P < 0.001 by Students t-test). The absolute difference in CT values of 4.1 cycles equates to 17.1-fold
absolute increase in AGR2 mRNA in subjects versus
controls. Further, we explored the correlation between AGR2 mRNA expression and CTC enumeration in the CRPC subgroup. A strong positive

correlation is observed between CTC enumeration
and AGR2 mRNA level (R2  0.74, P < 0.001, Fig. 1).
We conclude that AGR2 mRNA is expressed in CTCs
from patients with metastatic CRPC.
Plasma AGR2 Levels are Elevated in Metastatic
Prostate Cancer
Having demonstrated CTC-based expression of
AGR2 mRNA in CTCs, we next expanded our study
to examine plasma AGR2 levels in patients with metastatic prostate cancer. Since AGR2 is known to be
an androgen-regulated, secreted protein which is
elevated in plasma in ovarian and pancreatic cancer

5

[23,24], we reasoned that plasma AGR2 levels may be
elevated and vary in response to therapies in patients
with metastatic prostate cancer.
An ELISA assay was used to explore plasma AGR2
and CGA levels in patients with metastatic prostate
cancer compared with normal controls (Fig. 2). Consistent with other reports, we observed a median
(range) of 25 (6170) ng/ml AGR2 in normal male
subjects (n  18). However, we found that plasma
AGR2 values were significantly elevated in each cohort of patients with metastatic prostate cancer. Specifically, we observed AGR2 values of 105 (20285), 75
(102500), and 945 (501,035) ng/ml for patients in
the CSPC, CRPC, and NE-CRPC cohorts, respectively
(P < 0.05 for each comparison). The median (range)
of CGA levels in normal subjects was 70 (22714)
ng/ml, which is consistent with the assays normal
value of <100 ng/ml. We observed CGA values of 68
(39206), 92 (10551), and 174 (151235) ng/ml for
patients in the CSPC, CRPC, and NE-CRPC cohorts,
respectively. Only the NE-CRPC cohort had significantly different CGA levels than normals (P < 0.05).
We conclude that plasma AGR2 is significantly
elevated in patients with metastatic prostate cancer
compared with normal male controls.
Plasma AGR2 Levels do not CorrelateWith PSA
Serum PSA levels are almost uniformly elevated in
patients with metastatic prostate cancer, where it is
used as a therapeutic biomarker [30]. As both PSA
and AGR2 levels are androgen regulated secreted
proteins, we explored whether AGR2 levels correlate

with PSA. First, we explored whether plasma AGR2
relates to PSA on a per sample basis and found a
weak and non-significant correlation (R2  0.08,
P  0.07; Supplementary Figure). Next, as changes in
PSA values are used as a biomarker associated with
response to multiple therapies in CRPC, we explored
sequential measurements of AGR2 and PSA. In 10
subjects (CRPC n  7, CSPC n  2, NE-CRPC n  1),
sequential samples were available representing baseline and serial measurements at weeks 36 and 1012
in response to standard therapies (Fig. 3). In this preliminary analysis, we observe no clear trend in comparing changes in PSA or AGR2 values in response to
standard therapies. In some subjects, a discordant
pattern is observed such that AGR2 levels changed
inversely with PSA values (Fig. 3E, H, and I). In other
subjects AGR2 levels seemed to closely track declining (Fig. 3A, B, and J) or increasing (Fig. 3C) PSA values. A third pattern with stable AGR2 levels despite
decreasing PSA (Fig. 3D, F, and G) was also observed.
We conclude that plasma AGR2 and PSA vary independently in relation to treatments used for metastatic
prostate cancer.

AGR2 Expression is Associated With a
Neuroendocrine Phenotype
We noted that the sub-group of patients with the
highest median AGR2 expression included three subjects with NE-CRPC. As NE-CRPC remains generally
a poorly defined clinical entity, we sought to more
precisely describe the clinical and serologic characteristics of these patients (Table II). As expected, patients
with NE-CRPC exhibit an unusual pattern of metastatic spread which includes sites such as lung, liver,
bone, eye, and brain in addition to the conventional
metastatic pattern involving osteoblastic metastases
to bone. Chromagranin A (CGA) and other blood
based markers are commonly used to help characterize patients with NE-CRPC [31]. We note that CGA is
elevated in all subjects with NE-CRPC. Other serum
markers such as carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) and
neuron-specific enolase (NSE) are also elevated along
with AGR2 in many of these subjects as well. We conclude that plasma AGR2 may be used along with
CGA, and other serum markers, to help define NECRPC.

AGR2 is a Biomarker of Metastatic Prostate Cancer
As NE-CRPC represents an uncommon clinical
variant of metastatic prostate cancer, we used prostate
cancer cell lines to further explore a possible association between AGR2 and neuroendocrine marker expression in prostate cancer cells (Fig. 4). PC3 is a
human prostate cancer cell line which is known to express high levels of AGR2 and exhibit other characteristics associated with neuroendocrine prostate cancer
[9,10,32]. 22Rv1 is an androgen-responsive human
prostate cancer cell line which was also found to
expresses AGR2 and is tumorogenic in immune-compromised mice [33,34]. PC3 and 22Rv1 cells were
infected with a lentivirus expressing shRNA against
AGR2 or a scrambled-shRNA as a control. Down-regulation of AGR2 expression in PC3 and 22Rv1 cells
resulted in concordant decreases in CGA levels compared to cells infected with scramble-shRNA control
virus (Fig. 4, left and middle panels). DU145 represents and androgen receptor negative human prostate
cancer cell line which is generally not tumorogenic
and does exhibit appreciable amounts of AGR2. Stable transfectants of DU145 cells were made with ectopic expression of AGR2 or green fluorescent protein
(GFP) as a control. In the DU145 cells, we observed
that increased expression of AGR2 resulted in a significant increase in CGA expression (Fig. 4, right panel). A similar pattern correlating AGR2 and NSE
expression was observed in PC3 and DU145 cells, but
was not as pronounced in 22RV1 cells. We conclude
that AGR2 expression generally correlates with CGA
and NSE expression in prostate cancer cell lines.

Fig. 4. CGA and NSE levels are modulated by AGR2. Prostate
cancer cell lines (22Rv1,PC3, and DU145) were transduced with lentiviral particles to knockdown AGR2 (shRNA in 22Rv1and PC3) or
induce overexpression (cDNA in DU145) as compared to control
(scrambled) or (GFP) vectors, respectively. AGR2, CGA, NSE, and
actin expressionin celllysates were determinedbyimmunoblot.

DISCUSSION
AGR2 is widely expressed in normal mucus-producing and endocrine-responsive cells in lung, stomach, colon, pancrease, breast, and prostate [7].
Microdissection studies show that AGR2 expression
is elevated in prostate carcinoma compared to adjacent normal tissue, and urine-based detection of
AGR2 has been proposed as a potential diagnostic
marker for prostate cancer [10]. Conflicting data exist
concerning the potential for tissue-based measurements of AGR2 levels to add to standard prognostic
markers used to risk-stratify patients with newly diagnosed prostate cancer [11,12]. Despite strong data
supporting a role for AGR2 in promoting a metastatic
phenotype in pre-clinical models, expression of AGR2
in metastatic prostate cancer has not been previously
explored [5].
Here, we utilized a combination of blood-based
approaches to evaluate AGR2 expression in patients
with metastatic prostate cancer. First, we used peripheral-blood RNA enriched for the presence of CTCs towards determining if AGR2 mRNA expression was
elevated in cancer cells in patients with metastatic
prostate cancer. We conclude that AGR2 is expressed
in metastatic prostate cancer as evidenced by finding
a significant correlation between CTC enumeration
and AGR2 mRNA expression. However, as CTCs are
not present in all patients and may not accurately reflect AGR2 expression in all tumor deposits, we utilized an AGR2 ELISA assay to quantify plasma AGR2
levels in patients with metastatic prostate cancer. We
find that plasma AGR2 levels are significantly elevated in patients with metastatic prostate cancer versus
normal male controls. Further, our preliminary results
show that plasma AGR2 levels can vary in response
to androgen-directed and other therapies used for
patients with metastatic prostate cancer. Finally, we
noted very high plasma AGR2 levels in patients with
a neuroendocrine or anaplastic variant of metastatic prostate cancer and suggest that AGR2 expression correlates with expression of neuroendocrine
markers (CGA and NSE) in prostate cancer cells.
Despite strong data implicating AGR2 expression
in a metastatic phenotype, a mechanistic connection
between AGR2 expression and metastatic progression
remains elusive. Persson et al. [3] have demonstrated
that AGR2 may be a novel type of the protein disulfide isomerase (PDI). Members of the PDI family have
roles associated with oxioreduction during protein
folding in the endoplasmic reticulum [35]. However,
the possible enzymatic effects or down-stream targets
of AGR2 expression or activation remains generally
unexplored. Induction of AGR2 levels in response to
steroid treatment in breast [36] and prostate [2] cancer
has been demonstrated. This would suggest that

increasing tissue expression of AGR2 should be correlated with PSA concentration. Our results do not support this hypothesis and instead indicate that
serological AGR2 and PSA are decoupled in prostate
cancer (Fig. 3). This is further supported by the inverse relationship between AGR2 and PSA levels in
NE-CRPC patients (Fig. 2).
NE-CRPC represents an extreme example of the
clinical situation where PSA levels are neither elevated nor useful as a therapeutic marker in metastatic prostate cancer. Areas of neuroendocrine
differentiation are commonly found in histologic
sections representing prostate adenocarcinoma,
however the clinical significance of these findings
remain controversial [37]. For patients with metastatic prostate cancer, a neuroendocrine or anaplastic phenotype has more recently started to be
defined in hopes of identifying patients who may
benefit from more intensive cytotoxic chemo-hormonal therapy [31,38]. While no clear consensus
definition has emerged for NE or anaplastic
CRPC, clinical features used to define this entity
often include characteristics such as: (i) the presence of extensive visceral metastases; (ii) low PSA
values (typically <10 ng/ml); (iii) osteolytic bone
metastases; and (iv) a short duration of response to
ADT. Conventional plasma or serum markers often
elevated in NE-CRPC include CGA, NSE, and CEA
[28,39]. However, not all patients with NE-CRPC
can be identified, let alone followed with the available blood-based markers. Our data suggests that
plasma AGR2 levels may be used to help define
and potentially better direct treatment for NECRPC. A limitation of our study is that the clinical
association between elevated plasma AGR2 levels
and NE-CRPC is based on a small sub-sample
(n  3) of our overall cohort. Additional studies

adenopathy; multiple liver metastases; extensive
osteoblastic bone metastases
Bilateral adrenal nodules; eye (choroid); brain
(parafalcine mass); retroperiteoneal lymphadenopathy;
multiple mixed osteolytic/osteoblastic bone metastases

involving larger numbers of patients would be required to validate any such association.
Significant effort has been placed on the identification of biomarkers which would enable oncologists to
better understand prostate cancer progression. This is
especially important with patients with metastatic
prostate cancer, as PSA levels do not always correlate
with disease progression or therapeutic efficacy. In
fact, patients with anaplastic prostate cancer are characterized by low PSA levels and typically have poor
prognosis. In summary, we propose that plasma
AGR2 levels may be useful to help characterize, monitor, and direct therapies for patients with metastatic
prostate cancer. Additional research is needed to better understand potential mechanistic and prognostic
implications of AGR2 expression in relation to the underlying tumor biology and disease course in patients
with prostate cancer.
