Abstract

Background: BRAF mutation has been investigated as a prognostic factor in metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC)
undergoing anti-EGFR monoclonal antibodies (moAbs), but current results are still inconclusive. The aim of this meta-
analysis was to evaluate the relationship between BRAF mutation status and the prognosis of mCRC patients treated with
moAbs.

Methods: Eligible studies were identified by systematically searching Pubmed, the Cochrane Library, Web of Knowledge,
and OVID. Risk ratio (RR) for overall response rate (ORR), Hazard ratios (HRs) for Progression free survival (PFS) and Overall
survival (OS) were extracted or calculated. Prespecified subgroup analyses were conducted in KRAS wild-type and in
different study types. The source of between-trial variation was explored by sensitivity analyses. Quality assessment was
conducted by the Haydens criteria.

Results: A total of twenty one trials including 5229 patients were identified for the meta-analysis. 343 patients displayed
BRAF mutations of 4616 (7.4%) patients with known BRAF status. Patients with BRAF wild-type (WT) showed decreased risks
of progression and death with an improved PFS(HR 0.38, 95% confidence intervals 0.290.51) and an improved OS (HR 0.35
[0.290.42]), compared to BRAF mutant. In KRAS WT population, there were even larger PFS benefit (HR 0.29[0.19,0.43]) and
larger OS benefit (HR 0.26 [0.20,0.35]) in BRAF WT. A response benefit for BRAF WT was observed (RR 0.31[0.18,0.53]) in KRAS
WT patients, but not observed in unselected patients (RR 0.76 [0.431.33]). The results were consistent in the subgroup
analysis of different study types. Heterogeneity between trials decreased in the subgroup and explained by sensitivity
analysis. No publication bias of ORR, PFS and OS were detected.

Conclusions: The results indicate that BRAF mutant is a predictive biomarker for poor prognosis in mCRC patients
undergoing anti-EGFR MoAbs therapy, especially in KRAS WT patients. Additional large prospective trials are required to
confirm the predictive role of BRAF status.

Introduction

cancer

is

Colorectal

the third mostly common human
malignant tumor and is one major cause of cancer mortality
in the western world [1]. Metastatic tumors account for 40% to
50% of newly diagnosed patients
[2]. The prognosis of
metastatic colorectal cancer(mCRC) remains poor. The intro-
duction of targeted Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR)
Monoclonal Antibodies
(MoAbs), namely Cetuximab and
Panitumumab, has distinctly improved Overall response rate
(ORR), Progression free survival
(PFS) and Overall survival
(OS). EGFR is a transmembrane tyrosine kinase receptor,which

and

[3]. However, only 10%20% of
patients with mCRC can achieve benefits
from anti-EGFR
MoAbs [4]. EGFR expression is reported to be not correlated
with clinical efficacy [5]. The benefit of targeted agents may
attribute to the inhibition of its downstream signaling pathways,
mainly RAS-RAF-MAPK and P3IK-PTEN-AKT [6]. Increas-
ing evidences show that KRAS mutations at codons 12 and 13
in mCRC are predictive biomarkers of resistance to anti-EGFR
MoAbs [7]. But KRAS mutations account only for 35% to 45%
of nonresponders [8].

Recently, BRAF mutation (.95% of BRAF point mutations
occure at BRAF V600E [9]) is introduced to be associated with
resistance to targeted agents [10]. BRAF protein, a serine-
threonine kinase, is the principal downstream molecular of KRAS
[11]. A meta-analysis by Bokemeyer C, et al, in 2012 [12] based
on two RCTs (the OPUS and CRYSTAL trials) reported that in
KRAS wild-type(WT) patients, adding cetuximab to chemother-
apy was beneficial for BRAF WT patients, but not for BRAF
mutant patients. Another systematic review by Mao C, et al, in
2011 [13] found a response benefit for BRAF WT in KRAS WT
patients, but
for BRAF WT in
unselected patients. And there is no meta-analysis for direct
comparisons of PFS and OS between BRAF mutant and BRAF
WT in mCRC patients using anti-EGFR MoAbs.

found no response benefit

Here we aimed to provide a comprehensive, unbiased pooled
analysis including ORR (risk ratio [RR] in patients with mutant
BRAF versus(vs) these with WT BRAF) for response, PFS and OS
(hazard ratios [HR] in patients with WT BRAF vs mutant BRAF)
for progression and survival in patients with mCRC receiving anti-
EGFR MoAbs therapies.

tumor, malignan*). Article types were restricted to clinical
trials or Randomized Controlled Trials (RCT)
in human. To
ensure all related studies enrolled, we hand-searched several years
of major journals such as ASCO (American Society of Clinical
Oncology), ASCRS (American Society of Colon and Rectal
Surgeons) and JCO (Journal of Clinical Oncology). The reference
lists of primary studies and previous meta-analysis were scrutinized
for additional publications.

The full electronic searching strategy in Pubmed was as follow:
(BRAF or BRAF*) and (colon* or rectal or colorectal
or rectum) and (cancer or carcinom* or neoplas* or
tumor or malignan* or crc); Article types were restricted to
Clinical Trial and Randomized Controlled Trial.

Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria

The potential trials were screened for the following criteria: (1)
patients with mCRC treated with cetuximab or panitumumab
based therapy; (2) evalutaing BRAF mutations in the majority of
patients and the number of patients with mutated BRAF was no
less than one; (3) reported one or more indicators (including ORR,
PFS and OS) to compare the prognosis of patients with WT BRAF
to these with mutant BRAF; (4) retrospective trials, prospective
trials, or randomized controlled trials. Trials evaluating progres-
sion with time to tumor progression (TTP), when TTP was defined
as the time from the initiation date of Cetuximab or Panitumumab
containing therapy to the first radiographic evidence of disease
progression or death, were also included. We exlcuded trials
without complete data, trials still in progression, and these without
full text articles online. When reports overlapped or repeated, we
retrived the data with longest follow up.

Data Extraction and Definitions

Data were extracted including the first author, publication year,
patient baseline characteristics, the number of patients analyzed in

line of

treatment,

study design,

the study, the number of patients with known BRAF mutation, the
percentage of patients with Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group
(ECOG) performance status #1point, the proportion of liver only
metastasis,
chemotherapy
regimens, anti-EGFR MoAbs used and the response criteria. For
clinical outcome, we collected the number of responders for
calculating RRs and 95% estimation intevals for ORR. We also
extracted HRs and 95% credibility intervals for PFS and OS. If
separate HR was not provided, we estimated HR and its variance
from published survival curves by previously described methods
and models [14,15]. Adjusted HRs and estimation intervals were
also collected when reported.

Overall response included complete response (CR) and partial
response (PR), non-response consisted of stable disease (SD) and
progression disease (PD) according to the Response Evaluation
Criteria in Solid Tumors
(RECIST) [16] or World Health
Organization (WHO) criteria [17]. PFS was defined as the time
from the initiation date of anti-EGFR moAbs therapy to first
evidence of disease progression or death of any cause, OS was
defined as the time from the initiation date of anti-EGFR moAbs
therapy to death of any cause. Outcome data were extracted
separately in unselected population and in KRAS WT population.
All data above were extracted by two independent investigators.
When discrepancies existed, discussions were made to reach a
consensus.

Assessment of Study Quality

For assessing the risk of bias in individual study, we used the
Haydens criteria to assess the quality [18]. This is based on six
domains of potential study biases which should be included in a
review of prognostic studies: study participation, study attrition,
measurement of prognostic factors, measurement of confounding
variables, mesurement of outcomes, and analysis methods. The
criteria is not scored, but we designed a scoring scale based on the
Haydens criteria with some modifications to this study to quantize
the assessment. The maximum score for each item was 2. Studies
scoring 1012 were defined as high quality, while these scoring 0
9 were considered low quality, just as previously defined by Maan
ZN, et al. [19] (Table S1).

Statistical Analysis

We described statistics for baseline characteristics across eligible
studies. A Risk ratio (RR) of ORR was calculated by the formula
a=(azb)=c=(czd)
(a, b represented for the numbers of
responders and nonresponders in BRAF mutant; c,d represented
for the numbers of responders and nonresponders in BRAF WT in
the same arm ) [20]. A HR and its variance were used directly if
the trials provided. If not appropriate for direct analysis, we
converted a HR and variance according to previous reported
methods [14,15]. When not reported, a HR was estimated
indirectly from other statistics such as log rank p value or
calculated from published Kaplan-Meier
survival curves by
methods and models previously mentioned [14,15,21]. A RR,1
for response (BRAF mutation vs BRAF WT), and HRs,1 for PFS
and OS (BRAF WT vs BRAF mutation) revealed poorer pognosis
of patients with mutated BRAF over these with WT BRAF in anti-
EGFR treatments.

Between-trial heterogeneity was assessed by both Q2 statistic
and I2 statistic for more reliability. For Q2 statistic, significant
heterogeneity existed when p value was less than 0.10 [22]. For I2
statistic, values above 50% were deemed to suggest
large
heterogeneity; values between 25%50% indicated modest het-
erogeneity; values below 25% meant low heterogeneity [23]. But
the values could be largely uncertain when few trials were pooled.

If the results of Q2 statistic and I2 statistic were conflicted, the
conclusion of I2 statistic was adpoted. The effect sizes across trials,
namely pooled HRs and RRs, were estimated using the fixed-
effect model by Mantel-Haenszel method when no significant
heterogeneity existed(X2 test: p$0.10). A random-effect model by
Dersimonian and Laird method was adopted when there was a
noted heterogeneity (X2 test: p,0.10) [22,24]. The source of
heterogeneity was explored by sensitivity analysis when large
heterogeneity was presented. All p values reported were two-sided.
(P,0.05
represented existing publication bias) and were reflected by visual
symmetry of Beggs funnel plot on the natural logarithm of RRs or
HRs [25].

Publication bias were assessed by Eggers

test

Prespecified subgroup analysis was conducted in KRAS WT
patients, as increasing evidence suggested KRAS mutation to be a
predictor for resistance to anti-EGFR MoAbs therapy [26].
Subgroup analysis was also conducted according to different study
types such as retrospective, prospective trials and RCT in both
unselected population and KRAS population, to explore whether
the results of meta-analysis from different study types being
consistent. Sensitivity analyses were performed to evaluate the
stability of pooled results by deleting one trial each time. The
source of heterogeneity was also explored when strong heteroge-
neity between-trial existed. All the statistical analyses in the meta-
analysis were performed with STATA software, version 11.0 (Stata
Corporation, College Station, TX, USA, http://www.stata.com).

applied regimen was Cetuximab plus Irinotecan (in eleven trials).
For quality assessment, ten studies [2734,44,45] were within high

were within low quality scoring from 79 (Table 1).

were analyzed. BRAF status was available among 4616 patients
(88.3% of the total analyzed). 343 patients (7.4% of the patients

with known BRAF status) displayed BRAF mutations. The
mutated site was mostly V600E mutation at the extron 15 of
BRAF gene. Around 60% of patients enrolled were men and
median age were 6173 years across trials. The majority of
patients had good performance status with the proportion of
ECOG/WHO score 01 point being more than 90%. Five trials
[27,28,30,32,35] reported metastases confined to the liver only
and the average percentage of liver only metastases was 24%
(Table 2).

Eighteen trials of 21 trials reported the numbers of responses:
ten trials [28,32,35,3843,47] reported responses in unselected
population, seven trials [27,30,33,34,36,37,45] reported responses
in KRAS WT population, one trial [46] reported in both
population. The remaining three trials [29,31,44] did not report
the number of responses. As for HRs and estimation intervals of
PFS and OS in all 21 trials, three trials [33,43,46] reported HRs
and estimation intervals in both unselected patients and KRAS
WT patients, while two trials [31,32] reported only in unselected
population. Four trials [27,30,35,45] did not convert HRs as we
wanted. Four
[29,34,36,37] provided survival curves
available for separately calculating HRs and variances for PFS
and OS, to compare BRAF WT to BRAF mutant patients. Eight
studies [28,3843,47] did not have sufficient data on HRs and
estimation intervals for PFS and OS. (Table 3).

Meta-analysis

We performed three different meta-analyses (namely RR for
ORR, HRs for PFS and OS) upon unselected patients, KRAS WT
patients only, and different study types. Larger benefits were
observed for BRAF WT patients, with an improved PFS (HR 0.38,
95%CI [0.290.51], p,0.001, Figure 2B), albeit with differences
across trials (Heterogeneity p = 0.018, I2 = 56.5%, random effect
model, Figure 2B), comparing to BRAF mutant patients. In
subgroup analysis of different study types, variation decreased to
below 50% (Heterogeneity p = 0.108, I2 = 44.7%, random effect
model, Figure 2B) across retrospective trials. There was also
enough evidence of an improved OS for WT BRAF patients (HR
[0.290.42], p,0.001, Figure 2C) with no significant
0.35,
differences between trials (Heterogeneity p = 0.170, I2 = 31.1%,
fixed effect model, Figure 2C), comparing to BRAF mutation. But
difference for ORR (RR 0.76, [0.43,1.33], p = 0.328) was not
significant when comparing BRAF mutant to BRAF wild-type,
with no significant heterogeneity across
(Heterogeneity
p = 0.099, I2 = 36.5%, random effect model, Figure 2A). No
publication bias were found in the three pooled analysis above by
Eggers test (ORR: p = 0.481, PFS: p = 0.185; OS: p = 0.691).
Beggs Funnel plots of ORR, PFS, and OS were listed as Figure
S1, Figure S2 and Figure S3.

In the subgroup analysis of different study types in KRAS

We then performed meta-analysis of ORR, PFS and OS

considerable differences between the

subgroup analysis of retrospective trials, heterogeneity decreased

analysis, we tried to explore the source of heterogeneity from study
quality, age and sex, but we didnt
the source.
Heterogeneity across trials may come from others (Table S2).
We also conducted sensitivity analysis by deleting one study each
time and the results were still consistent (results not provided in the
study), which revealed the stability of the conclusion.There was
also evidence of an OS benefit in BRAF WT patients (HR 0.26,

suggestion of variation across trials (Heterogeneity p = 0.814,

overall rate of BRAF mutation (7.4%) was similar to previously
reported series [48]. The results demonstrated that patients with
BRAF WT had decreased risks of progression (PFS: HR 0.38,
p,0.001) and death (OS: HR 0.35, p,0.001)
than patients
with BRAF mutant. However, evidence of increased response in
patients with BRAF WT was not enough (p = 0.328) comparing
to BRAF mutated patients. In the subgroup analysis of different
study types, there were still benefits for PFS and OS, but also
not enough evidence of a response benefit
for BRAF WT
patients. In KRAS WT patients, results showed patients with
BRAF WT not only decreased the risks of progression (PFS:
HR 0.29, p,0.001) and death (OS: HR 0.26, p,0.001), but
also increased responses
these with BRAF
mutant. Results were still consisted in the subgoup analysis of
differents study types. Differences decreased in subgroup analysis
and the conclusions didnt change in the sensitivity analysis.

(p,0.001) over

Although a previous meta-analysis from Mao C, et al [13]
demonstrates larger response benefit of anti-EGFR MoAbs in
BRAF WT patients over BRAF mutant patients, they did not
compare other indicators such as PFS and OS. Another published
meta-analysis based on the OPUS and CRYSTAL trials from
Bokemeyer C, et al, [12] indicates that adding Cetuximab to
chemotherapy in mCRC is beneficial for BRAF WT patients, not
for BRAF mutant patients. However, the study involves only two
RCTs and is conducted only in KRAS WT patients. Direct
comparison between BRAF mutant and BRAF WT on effects of

MoAbs is also not reported. In this meta-analysis, we made direct
comparison on effects of MoAbs between patients with mutant and
WT BRAF. Generally speaking, our results confirmed that mCRC
patients with BRAF mutant treated with MoAbs have poorer
prognosis than these with BRAF WT, especially in KRAS WT
population.

We know the limitations of our meta-analysis. Firstly,
retrospective trials were also included, which may cause selective
bias. Secondly, only four trials reported HRs and variances as we
wanted. We had to calculate or convert HRs and variances for
other trials from reported survival curves, which may introduce
unavoidable bias. Thirdly, size effects from retrospective and
prospectived trials are unadjusted, whilst size effects from RCTs
are adjusted by patient baseline characteristics. Because individual
patient data was not available, we conducted meta-analysis based
on unadjusted and adjusted estimations,which may introduce
confounding bias. Finally, the first and second end points were
incosistant across different trials, so we didnt define them in this
review.

Despite these limitations above, we confirm the conclusion that
BRAF mutant is a predictive biomarker for poor prognosis in
mCRC patients receiving anti-EGFR MoAbs therapy, especially
in patients with KRAS WT. Therefore, screening for BRAF WT
may promote the selection of potential mCRC patients whom will
benefit from anti-EGFR moAbs.
