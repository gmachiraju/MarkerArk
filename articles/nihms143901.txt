Abstract

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Activated leukocyte cell adhesion molecule (ALCAM) has been implicated in tumorigenesis. Our
goal was to examine the levels of ALCAM, in addition to the classical breast cancer tumor
markers carbohydrate antigen 15-3 (CA15-3) and carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), in serum by
quantitative ELISA for diagnosis in breast cancer patients. The three proteins were measured in
serum of 100 healthy women, 50 healthy men and 150 breast carcinoma patients. The diagnostic
sensitivity and specificity of the tests were calculated and the association of serum marker
concentrations with various clinicopathologic variables was examined using nonparametric
Kruskal-Wallis tests. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were used to evaluate the
diagnostic performance of the biomarkers. ALCAM, with area under the curve (AUC) of 0.78
[95% CI: 0.73, 0.84] outperformed CA15-3 (AUC= 0.70 [95% CI: 0.64, 0.76]) and CEA (AUC=
0.63 [95% CI: 0.56, 0.70]). The incremental values of AUC for ALCAM over that for CA15-3
were statistically significant (Delong test, p <0.05). Combining CA15-3 and ALCAM yielded a
ROC curve with an AUC of 0.81 (95% CI [0.75, 0.87]). Serum ALCAM appears to be a new
biomarker for breast cancer and may have value for disease diagnosis.

Introduction
Over one million new breast cancer cases are diagnosed each year1. It is a heterogeneous
disease with a wide range of histological, clinical and molecular presentations.
Unfortunately, other than definitive diagnosis by biopsy and histopathology, no diagnostic
or screening test is presently suitable for early detection of breast cancer2. The ability to

detect human malignancy via a simple blood test has long been a major objective in medical
screening. Carbohydrate antigen 15-3 (CA15-3) and carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA),
discovered more than two and four decades ago, respectively, are the most commonly used
tumor markers for breast cancer3-5. CA15-3 and CEA levels in serum are recommended for
monitoring therapy of advanced breast cancer2. However, these cancer biomarkers have
proven to be ineffective in detecting the early stages of the disease due to low diagnostic
sensitivity and specificity6-8. Clearly, new tumor markers are urgently needed for screening,
diagnosis, prognosis or selection of therapy of breast cancer patients.

We have previously performed an extensive proteomic analysis of tissue culture
supernatants from three different breast cancer cell lines9. Over 1,000 proteins were
identified in our proteomic analysis. Based on literature searches, from the top 100
differentially expressed proteins (as defined by spectral counting), 46 of the molecules had
been previously examined as a serological breast cancer marker. The remaining proteins
were scrutinized to select proteins for further investigation that was found only in the
conditioned media of breast cancer cell lines and absent in MCF-10A (semi-normal breast
epithelial cell line). This filtering criterion resulted in 30 candidates for further analysis. Of
these 30 candidates, 11 of them had reagents available to develop an immunoassay to
measure the levels of these proteins in biological fluids. Analyzing the serum of healthy
individuals and patients with breast cancer resulted in one promising candidate molecule:
activated leukocyte cell adhesion molecule (ALCAM) (Supplementary Figure 1).

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Cell adhesion molecules are cell surface receptors that mediate cell-cell and cell-substrate
interactions. These molecules can be grouped into four families: integrins, cadherins,
selectins and the immunoglobulin superfamily (Ig-SF)10. Alterations in cellular adhesion
and communication can contribute to uncontrolled cell growth11. In this respect, ALCAM is
a type 1 transmembrane glycoprotein of the Ig-SF12. The molecular weight of ALCAM is
65kDa but with N-glycosylation at 8 putative sites, the mature ALCAM molecule has a
molecular weight of 110kDa13. Five extracellular Ig domains, a transmembrane region and a
short cytoplasmic tail make up the ALCAM protein that resembles E-cadherin in motifarrangement12. ALCAM mediates both heterophilic (ALCAM-CD6) and homophilic
(ALCAM-ALCAM) cell-cell interactions14. The extracellular structures of ALCAM provide
two structurally and functionally distinguishable modules, one involved in ligand binding (to
CD6)15 and the other in avidity14, 16. Physiologically, ALCAM is expressed in activated
leukocytes and neural, epithelial and hematopoietic progenitor cells17. Functionally,
ALCAM may act as a cell surface sensor to register local growth saturation and to regulate
cellular signaling and dynamic responses18. ALCAM-CD6 interaction is required for
optimal activation of T-cells suggesting a possible ALCAM involvement in the
immunologic response to tumor cells19. ALCAM may favor interactions between tumor and
endothelial cells18.
The aim of our study was to investigate if ALCAM, either alone, or in combination with the
classical breast cancer biomarkers (CA15-3 and CEA) represent a new strategy for breast
cancer diagnosis with high sensitivity and specificity in serum, using quantitative
methodologies. The association between serum marker concentrations with various
clinicopathologic parameters was also examined.

Materials and Methods
Patients and Specimens
The clinical material used consisted of 150 serum samples from breast cancer patients (ages
34 to 82 years; median, 62 years), 100 serum samples from normal, apparently healthy
women (ages 24 to 56 years; median, 40 years), and as an additional control, 50 serum

samples from normal healthy men (ages 23 to 61 years; median, 48 years). Serum samples
from healthy subjects were obtained through the Preventive Medical Unit at Venice General
Hospital. The subjects were asked to donate blood samples for studies on tumor biomarkers
and then asked to fill out a complete patient form. Any subjects that had a history of any
serious or chronic illnesses or neoplasms were eliminated from the sample collection. The
breast carcinoma serum samples were obtained on the morning prior to surgery and prior to
any treatment. Peripheral blood samples were drawn by venopuncture after overnight fasting
between 8 and 8:30 AM. Serum was collected in a Becton Dickinson vacutainer, code n
°367896, containing a coagulation coactivator and kept at ambient temperature (20-25°C)
before centrifugation. They were centrifuged at 1500g at ambient temperature (20-25°C)
after 45 minutes and within 2 hours were aliquoted and snap frozen in liquid nitrogen and
immediately stored at -80°C. Of the 150 breast carcinoma patients, 32 were stage 1, 57 were
stage 2A or 2B, 27 were stage 3A or 3B and stage information was not available for the
remaining 34. Supplementary Table 1 contains detailed information on the 150 breast cancer
patient samples including their histology, grading (Elston-Ellis), diameter (cm), pT, pTNM,
stage and age. Clinical grades 1, 2 and 3, corresponding to 26, 62 and 56 patients,
respectively, were included in this study. The clinical characteristics of the breast cancer
patients are described later. Serum samples, obtained from Venice, Italy, from all patients
were stored at -80°C until further analysis. Our protocols have been approved by the review
boards of the participating institutions.

Measurement of ALCAM, CA15-3 and CEA in serum
The concentration of ALCAM in serum was measured by using a highly sensitive and
specific non-competitive “sandwich-type” ELISA, developed in our laboratory. The assay is
based on mouse monoclonal antibody capture and biotinylated mouse monoclonal detection
antibody (both obtained from R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN). The assay has a detection
limit of 0.05μg/L and a dynamic range of up to 10μg/L. Precision was less than 10% within
the measurement range. Serum samples were analyzed in triplicate with inclusion of two
quality control samples in every run. In addition, CA15-3 and CEA were measured using a
commercially available automated ELISA kit (Elecsys CA15-3 and CEA Immunoassay,
respectively; Roche Diagnostics, Indianapolis, IN). The upper limit of normal for CA15-3
for this method is 30 U/mL and for CEA is 5 ng/mL.
Data analysis and statistics

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

The relationships between biomarkers and patient and tumor characteristics were examined
with the Kruskal-Wallis test, a nonparametric method for examining differences among
multiple groups. Spearman's rank correlation coefficient was used to assess the correlations
among biomarkers. Logistic regression was performed to calculate the odds ratio (OR) that
defines the relation between biomarkers and case or control status. OR were calculated on
log-transformed biomarkers and were represented with their 95% confidence interval (95%
CI) and two-sided p-values.
To further evaluate the diagnostic usefulness of the markers for dichotomous classification,
we considered receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis. For each ROC curve,
we calculated the area under the curve (AUC). Bootstrap method was used to calculate the
confidence intervals for AUC. The ROC analysis was first conducted on individual markers
and then in combination, to explore the potential that a marker panel can lead to improved
performance. We considered an algorithm that renders a single composite score using the
linear predictor fitted from a binary regression model. This algorithm has been justified to be
optimal under the linearity assumption20 in the sense that ROC curve is maximized (i.e.,
best sensitivity) at every threshold value. Since an independent validation series was not
available for this study, the predictive accuracy of the composite scores was evaluated based

Results
ALCAM ELISA Assay Development
To ensure that the immunoassay was suitable for measuring clinical serum samples, the
recovery, reproducibility, linearity, cross-reactivity and serum sample stability were
examined. Recombinant human ALCAM protein was added into the general diluent
(control), normal serum (male and female) and into serum of breast cancer patients at
different concentrations, and measured with the ALCAM immunoassay. A recovery of
90-100% was observed in these samples. The assay also showed negligible cross-reactivity
to another adhesion molecule of the Ig-SF, B-cell adhesion molecule14, displayed excellent
linearity with serial dilutions and showed < 10% CV for intra- and inter-assay variability
studies (Supplementary Figure 2). Finally, the design of the stability study consisted of
collecting serum at different time points (2 weeks, 4 weeks and fresh samples) and storing
them at 4°C, −20°C and −80°C. ALCAM levels were measured in these samples using the
immunoassay. No difference was observed among the samples stored at the different
temperature conditions and among the different time point collections, compared to the
freshly obtained samples.

Association of Biomarkers with Age
Since cases and controls were not matched for age, we first explored if marker values
differed by age. The comparisons between cases and controls were based on data from
females only. While no change with age was observed for CA15-3 concentrations, the level
of CEA appeared to increase with age for both cases and controls. With respect to ALCAM,
there was a trend for marker level to increase with age for cases but not for controls (See
Supplementary Figure 3).
Correlations Among Biomarkers
Spearman's rank correlation coefficients were used to assess the correlations among markers
for female controls and cases, respectively, and the results are listed in Table 1. CEA
appeared to be weakly correlated with ALCAM in both cases (Spearman r = 0.371, p <
0.001) and controls (Spearman r = 0.348, p = 0.001), whereas CA15-3 was weakly
correlated with ALCAM among cases only (Spearman r = 0.2, p = 0.015).
Association of Biomarkers with Tumor Characteristics for Cases

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

The association of ALCAM, CA15-3 and CEA with patient and tumor characteristics such
as age, tumor diameter, ER and PgR status, grade, histology, ratio of lymph node positive
(lpos) and total lymph nodes (ltot), menopausal status, and stage were examined. A
significant association was obtained for the following clinicopathologic variables: age
(<=50, 51-60, 61-70 and >70), menopausal status (pre- and post-menopausal), and stage (I,
II, III). The distributions of each marker in cases for these variables are given in Table 2.
Post-menopausal women displayed higher values of CEA and ALCAM (all p < 0.001). As
well, levels of ALCAM were not significantly associated with stage whereas CEA and
CA15-3 were. Finally, while a statistically significant p-value was not obtained for an
association between ALCAM values and tumor grade, a general trend was observed with
elevated ALCAM levels corresponding to increased tumor grade (Supplementary Figure 4).

Association of Biomarkers with Breast Cancer

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

The distributions of the 3 markers, as measured by immunoassays, in cases and controls, are
shown in Figure 1. Distributions of the patients with breast cancer differed from controls
(female or male) for ALCAM, but to a lesser degree for the other two markers. The median
values of males and females were similar for all 3 markers. When comparing the ALCAM
values between normal women (n = 100) and patients with breast cancer (n = 150) by the
non-parametric Mann Whitney test (two-tailed), the medians were significantly different
(median normals = 60 μg/L; median cancer = 74 μg/L; P<0.0001). For CA15-3, the medians
were significantly different (median normals = 15 units/mL; median cancer = 21 units/mL;
P<0.0001). Lastly for CEA, the medians were different (median normals = 1.3 μg/L; median
cancer = 1.9 μg/L; P = 0.0003). The association of the markers with cancer was further
considered with linear regression models of logarithm-transformed marker values as a
function of clinical status (cancer vs non-cancer; females only) and age. Adjusting for age,
the mean levels of log(CA15-3) and log(ALCAM) were significantly higher in cancer;
levels of log(CEA) did not differ between cancer and controls.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

We also considered logistic regression models to further characterize the associations
between markers and breast cancer, adjusting for age. Similar to the results from linear
regression, we found that two individual markers, CA15-3 (OR=1.12, 95% CI [1.04,1.19])
and ALCAM (OR=1.42, 95% CI [1.14,1.77]) univariately predicted breast cancer, but this
was not the case for CEA (OR=0.99, 95% CI [0.95,1.05]). In a logistic regression model,
which included age and all three markers, we found that CA15-3 and ALCAM
independently predicted breast cancer. Results from the logistic regression models are given
in Table 3.
The Diagnostic Values of the Three Markers

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

ROC curve analysis (Figure 2) was used to quantify the diagnostic value of the three
markers. All three markers have AUC significantly better than 0.5, with ALCAM having the
best performance (AUC=0.78, 95% CI [0.73,0.84]). The superiority of ALCAM over the
other two markers was also evident when we considered sensitivities at fixed values of 90%
and 80% specificities, respectively (Table 4). For example, at specificity of 80%, ALCAM
yielded a sensitivity of 60%, compared with 48% for CA15-3. Likewise, at 90% specificity,
ALCAM displayed higher sensitivity than CA15-3 and CEA. Combining CA15-3 and
ALCAM, based on the linear predictors from a logistic regression model, yielded a ROC
curve with an AUC of 0.81 (bootstrap 95% CI [0.75, 0.87]). Combining CA15-3, ALCAM
and CEA did not result in any improvement in ROC curves compared to CA15-3 and
ALCAM. Re-sampling methods which aimed to adjust for over-fitting21 did not yield
substantially different results.

Discussion
Most primary cancers show loss of expression of adhesion molecules to allow for a critical
step in metastasis to occur: detachment of the invading cell from its neighbors 22, 23.
However, a number of potential reasons exist for observing elevated levels of adhesion
molecules such as ALCAM in cancer patients versus normal individuals. First, increased
homotypic intercellular adhesion (due to elevated levels of these molecules) may favor the
metastatic process since cell aggregates, rather than single cells breaking away from the
primary tumor, have a greater chance of survival in the circulation and of lodging in other
organs24. Second, it is known that cell adhesion is necessary for the metastatic spread of
cancer cells to new organs (secondary tumor establishment)23. As well, overproduction of
adhesion molecules may disrupt the normally operative intercellular adhesion forces,
allowing more cell movement and the adoption of a less ordered tissue architecture25. An

illustration of this is CEA, a member of the Ig-SF that is expressed in a variety of secretory
tissues26, 27. Interestingly, expression of CEA is increased in colon carcinomas and it may
be important to processes of intercellular recognition28, 29. It has been suggested that this
might either result in disturbance of normal intercellular adhesion or provide advantages in
further steps of metastasis25 such as conceivably facilitating establishment of a secondary
tumor23, 30.
ALCAM expression has been explored in a number of different tumor types displaying a
clear upregulation in some tumors and downregulation in others. In addition, variable levels
of ALCAM expression have been found at different stages of tumor development in the
same type of malignancies. In melanoma, ALCAM has been suggested to exhibit a role in
cell invasion and neoplastic progression31. In prostate carcinoma, ALCAM gene was found
upregulated in high Gleason grade prostate cancers compared to benign prostatic hyperplasia
cases32. However, one study observed an upregulation of ALCAM in low-grade tumors 33.
Yet, another study on prostate cancer found ALCAM to predict prostate-specific antigen
(PSA) relapse17. In colon cancer, using IHC, no significant correlation with patient age,
tumor grade, stage or nodal status and ALCAM expression was observed, but membranous
ALCAM expression correlated significantly with shortened patient survival34.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

There have been a few studies investigating ALCAM expression in breast cancer. Low
levels of ALCAM mRNA correlated with nodal involvement, high grade and worse
prognosis35, 36. At the protein level, laser scanning cytometry and confocal microscopy
showed that high levels of ALCAM correlated with small tumor diameter, low grade and the
presence of hormone receptors, which supported the view that this adhesion molecule is a
tumor suppressor with prognostic significance 12. However, an IHC analysis showed that
high cytoplasmic ALCAM expression was associated with shortened patient disease-free
survival37. Yet a further study found that ALCAM-ALCAM interactions between breast
cancer cells were important for survival in the primary tumor and that a loss of ALCAM was
associated with programmed cell death38. Finally, Ihnen et al discovered that patients with
high ALCAM mRNA expression who did not receive chemotherapy tended to have a worse
prognosis, suggesting that high ALCAM expression levels may be a marker for prediction of
the response to adjuvant chemotherapy in breast cancer39. Indeed, the discordant data
between RNA and protein levels of ALCAM in breast cancer and even discordance among
different protein expression studies suggest the need for additional research to evaluate the
role of ALCAM in breast cancer.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

The finding of decreased levels of ALCAM in breast cancer tissue compared to normal
breast tissue is not contradictory to our results of elevated levels of ALCAM in serum of
breast cancer patients. It is possible that ALCAM levels decrease in tissue but is elevated in
serum. For example, although PSA gene transcription is down-regulated in prostate cancer,
PSA protein levels in the circulation of prostate cancer patients increase due to disruption of
the anatomic barriers between the glandular lumen and capillaries. In addition, our data of
increased ALCAM levels in cancer versus healthy controls is in line with data about
ALCAM expression in prostate and colon cancer and melanoma. It should also be noted that
we are the first to report presence of ALCAM in serum of breast cancer patients. Until now,
all studies regarding ALCAM expression have been performed at the transcript level or
using IHC or confocal microscopy. In this study, we developed a robust and highly
sensitivity immunoassay to measure ALCAM in biological fluids.
It is generally agreed upon that no single cancer biomarker will provide all necessary
information for optimal cancer diagnosis. The current trend is to focus on the identification
of multiple biomarkers that can be used in combination. The present data provides evidence
that serum ALCAM represents a novel biomarker for breast cancer. This biomarker displays

higher diagnostic sensitivity for breast cancer than the currently used tumor markers CA15-3
and CEA (Table 4). Moreover, among the 120/150 cancer patients examined who displayed
normal levels of CA15-3 (< 30U/mL), 48 of them (40%) had elevated levels of ALCAM
(values of 78 μg/L or greater; the cut-off for 95% specificity). For this reason, CA15-3
measurements will benefit from combining ALCAM measurements, to increase the
diagnostic sensitivity of each of the markers alone. As well, assuming a 95% specificity, the
statistical power of our study (n = >100 for both control and cases) will allow the detection
of a 20% difference between mean values of ALCAM levels in breast cancer patients and
controls. The difference between the ALCAM means in this study was >20%, within the
power of our study. In addition, a correlation of elevated ALCAM levels with increasing age
was observed in breast carcinoma patients (Table 2). However, there was no correlation
between ALCAM levels and age of normal women (data not shown). This suggests that the
difference in age between cases and controls is not a confounding factor in this study.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

In conclusion, we show evidence that serum ALCAM concentration represents a novel
biomarker for breast carcinoma, which has potential utility as a diagnostic tool. The
combination of ALCAM with CA15-3 improved the diagnostic sensitivity. It is important to
note that both CA 15-3 and CEA levels in serum are related to tumour size and nodal
involvement and are recommended by international bodies such as ASCO (American
Society of Clinical Oncology) for monitoring therapy of advanced breast cancer; it is not
recommended as a diagnostic marker for breast cancer. However, when evaluating the
potential of a new marker such as the one presented in this study for breast cancer, a
benchmark molecule is needed for comparison. Since the only markers available for breast
cancer were CA 15-3 and CEA, both markers were used to compare the diagnostic
discriminatory ability. Moreover, the availability of a reliable immunoassay, such as the one
developed in this study, for measuring serum ALCAM may facilitate further studies to
establish the clinical usefulness of this marker in breast cancer. For example, examining the
levels of ALCAM in other serum samples such as those obtained from patients pre- and
post-surgery as well as serial serum samples collected from patients undergoing therapy may
be beneficial in evaluating the biomarker potential of ALCAM as a prognostic or predictive
marker of therapy. Further validation studies that integrate ALCAM with imaging
modalities, namely mammography, may reveal potential clinical utility of ALCAM for
breast cancer.
