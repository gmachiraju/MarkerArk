Abstract
Extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins, such as collagen type I and elastin, and
intermediate filament (IMF) proteins, such as vimentin are modified and dysregulated as part of the malignant changes leading to disruption of tissue
homeostasis. Noninvasive biomarkers that reflect such changes may have a great
potential for cancer. Levels of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) generated fragments of type I collagen (C1M), of elastin (ELM), and of citrullinated vimentin
(VICM) were measured in serum from patients with lung cancer (n = 40), gastrointestinal cancer (n = 25), prostate cancer (n = 14), malignant melanoma
(n = 7), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) (n = 13), and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) (n = 10), as well as in age-matched controls
(n = 33). The area under the receiver operating characteristics (AUROC) was
calculated and a diagnostic decision tree generated from specific cutoff values.
C1M and VICM were significantly elevated in lung cancer patients as compared
with healthy controls (AUROC = 0.98, P < 0.0001) and other cancers
(AUROC = 0.83 P < 0.0001). A trend was detected when comparing lung cancer with COPD+IPF. No difference could be seen for ELM. Interestingly, C1M
and VICM were able to identify patients with lung cancer with a positive predictive value of 0.9 and an odds ratio of 40 (95% CI = 8.7–186, P < 0.0001).
Biomarkers specifically reflecting degradation of collagen type I and citrullinated vimentin are applicable for lung cancer patients. Our data indicate that
biomarkers reflecting ECM and IMF protein dysregulation are highly applicable
in the lung cancer setting. We speculate that these markers may aid in diagnosing and characterizing patients with lung cancer.

Introduction
Lung cancer is a significant health issue and the leading
cause of cancer death [1, 2]. The disease is divided into
small cell lung cancer (SCLC) and nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC), with ~8 of 10 being NSCLC.
Currently, 75% of lung cancers are diagnosed late,
when tumors may be unresectable and treatment options
limited resulting in a 5-year survival rate of only 10% [3,
4]. No practical way of screening patients at risk of lung
cancer exists [5] and detection of lung cancer mostly
relies on imaging modalities such as computerized
tomography (CT) scans, which is not optimal [6]. Thus,
1136

improved diagnosis of lung cancer is essential for
enhanced survival.
Blood-based molecular biomarkers, which indicate that
patients have lung cancer and/or define high-risk
patients will have an enormous clinical potential. Unfortunately, the serum biomarkers currently in use for lung
cancer are limited to monitoring [7] and no validated
molecular biomarkers for the early detection of lung
cancer exist despite several investigations carried out
with this purpose [8].
Tumor biology includes a complex dynamic interaction
between tumor cells and the microenvironment that may
lead to a loss of overall tissue homeostasis and promote

Serum Biomarkers of Lung Cancer

tumor progression [9]. Consequently, biomarkers that
reflect such structural changes in the tissue as a whole, and
not just tumor cell changes, may have a great potential.
Novel noninvasive molecular cancer biomarkers may be
identified by exploiting a technology based on the concept
that tumor-associated proteases and tumor signature proteins, potentially combined with specific posttranslational
modifications, result in release of unique protein degradation fragments to the circulation [10]. The protein fragments contain pathology-specific neoepitopes that may
serve as specific cancer biomarker targets that most likely
enter the circulation by diffusing into the leaky vasculature found in tumor tissue.
In lung cancer, the intermediate filament (IMF) protein
vimentin has been shown to be applicable for clinical
pathology [11]. In addition, vimentin is regarded as a
canonical marker for the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) [12]. Vimentin has been identified as a surface and secreted protein [13–15] and may be a target for
proteolytic cleavage. Furthermore, vimentin has been
shown to be a target for citrullination by peptidylarginine
deiminase (PAD) enzymes which are activated during
apoptosis and inflammation [16, 17].
Extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling is another key
event in cancer [18]. The ECM integrating and surrounding malignant tumors is a central part of disease regulation and development. ECM remodeling involves
increased and altered local production of ECM proteins
(a phenomenon known as fibrosis or desmoplasia) as well
as increased and altered ECM degradation by upregulated
matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) activity [19]. Consequently, this leads to a different composition and quality
of the ECM as compared to the normal homeostatic state
[20].

In this study, we investigated whether serum biomarkers
reflecting ECM and IMF remodeling/dysregulation could
be used to differentiate lung cancer patients from healthy
controls, other lung pathologies, and other cancer types. In
detail, we measured specific protein fingerprints reflecting
MMP-degradation and citrullination of vimentin, MMPdegradation of type I collagen, the main component of the
structural interstitial ECM, and MMP-degradation of elastin which provides elasticity to the lung tissue.

Material and Methods
Patient samples
After informed consent and approval by appropriate
Institutional Review Board/Independent Ethical Committee, serum was collected from patients and age-matched
healthy controls with no symptomatic or chronic disease. Patient samples were obtained from the commercial vendors Asterand (Detroit, MI) and Proteogenex
(Culver City, CA) and the healthy controls were a pool
of samples from Asterand and another study population
[21]. According to Danish law, it is not required to get
ethical approval when measuring biochemical markers in
previously collected samples; hence, there was no additional ethical approval for this particular study. Demographics and clinical profiles are shown in Table 1.
Samples were all collected, processed, and stored in a
similar fashion until analyzed, and all analyses were performed blindly. Patient samples were collected prior to
surgery. Tumor stage and histological type were classified according to the criteria of the American Joint
Committee on Cancer (AJCC) and International Union
against Cancer (IUCC).

Serum Biomarkers of Lung Cancer

ELISA measurements and procedure
The levels of MMP-degraded type I collagen (C1M) [22],
MMP-degraded elastin (ELM) [23], and MMP-degraded
citrullinated vimentin (VICM) [24] were assessed in
serum samples using well characterized competitive
enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISAs). The targets were identified from in vitro and ex vivo studies and
by use of mass spectrometry and all the biomarker assays
are technically validated (see each reference for details).
In brief, the assays were performed by dissolving a biotinylated synthetic target peptide in an optimized assay buffer that was added to a 96-well streptavidin coated plate,
which then incubated for 30 min at 20°C. The plate was
washed five times in wash-buffer (20 mmol/L Tris,
50 mmol/L NaCl, pH 7.2) prior to addition of 20 lL target
peptide calibrator or sample and 100 lL of a horseradish
peroxidase-conjugated monoclonal antibody rose against
the target peptide-sequence of interest. The plate incubated
for 1–2 h at 20°C or overnight at 4°C, depending on the
individual assay. The plate was washed five times in washbuffer and finally 100 lL tetramethylbenzinidine (Kem-EnTec cat.438OH) was added and the plate was incubated for
15 min at 20°C in dark. The reaction was stopped by adding 100 lL of stopping solution (1% H2SO4) and the
OD450–650nm was measured.

Statistical analysis
The levels of the individual biomarkers in serum samples
were compared using analysis of variance (ANOVA) test
with Dunnetts test to adjust for multiple comparisons or
an unpaired t-test on Log10 transformed data. Data are
presented as Tukey box plots. The area under the receiver
operating characteristics (AUROC) was calculated for
each biomarker and for the biomarkers combined. A
diagnostic decision tree was generated from specific cutoff
values and analyzed using Fisher’s exact probability test
and the chi-square test. Statistical analyses were performed using MedCalc Statistical Software v.12 (MedCalc
Software, Ostend, Belgium) and GraphPad Prism v.6
(GraphPad Software, La Jolla, CA). Results were considered statistically significant if P < 0.05.

Results
Extracellular matrix degradation and
citrullinated vimentin degradation in serum
from patients with various cancers and
controls—lung cancer stands out
The levels of specific C1M, VICM, and ELM were measured in serum from various cancer patients and healthy
controls (Fig. 1A).

1138

N. Willumsen et al.

C1M was significantly elevated in all cancer types. The
highest levels were reached in lung cancer patients with
an average increase of eightfold (P < 0.0001) when compared to controls, and with the other cancer types having
a two- to threefold average increase (P < 0.05) as compared to controls. Furthermore, lung cancer patients had
significantly higher levels of C1M when compared to the
other cancer types (P < 0.05–0.0001).
Together, these findings indicate that altered collagen
turnover is ongoing in cancer, with lung cancer having
the highest levels of type I collagen degradation. This
reflects that alterations in the generation and degradation
of collagens and release of specific protein fragments to
the circulation are a pathological feature of cancer, especially lung cancer.
For VICM, the levels were significantly elevated only in
lung cancer. The average increase was approximately tenfold when compared to either healthy controls
(P < 0.0001) or the three other cancer types (P < 0.01–
0.0001). This finding indicates that citrullination and
MMP-degradation of (secreted) vimentin and the release
to the circulation is associated with lung cancer only and
not other cancer types.
Finally, no difference in the levels of ELM could be
detected, indicating that alterations in the generation and
release of these protein fragments to the circulation are not
a pathological feature of the cancers analyzed in this study.
Next, the AUROC was calculated as a measure of the
diagnostic power of the biomarkers individually and combined. This was done for all lung cancer patients versus the
healthy controls and for all lung cancers versus the other
cancer types analyzed in this study combined (GI, prostate,
and melanoma cancer) (Table 2). The results shows that
when analyzing all lung cancer patients versus healthy controls the diagnostic power of C1M, and VICM individually
were highly significant with an AUROC of 0.97 and 0.85,
respectively (P < 0.0001). The diagnostic power of ELM
was somewhat poorer with an AUROC of 0.67 (P = 0.013).
Interestingly, when combining C1M and VICM, a diagnostic power of 0.98 (P < 0.0001) was achieved, indicating
that a complete discrimination between healthy controls
and lung cancer patients is obtained. When the lung cancer
patients were compared to the other cancers combined, the
markers showed promising discriminative power as well.
Here, C1M and VICM individually as well as C1M and
VICM combined were highly significant with AUROCs of
0.81, 0.79, and 0.83, respectively (P < 0.001).

pathologies such as idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF)
and chronic obstructive pulmonary fibrosis (COPD). For
all the markers tested, no statistical difference could be
detected between lung cancer and either COPD and IPF
(Fig. 1B). However, clearly a trend toward increasing levels and a wider distribution of C1M and VICM was
observed in lung cancer. Furthermore, when calculating
the AUROC with respect to lung cancer versus other lung
pathologies (i.e., IPF and COPD combined) (Table 2),
the discrimination turned out significant for C1M alone
with an AUROC of 0.64 (P < 0.05), and for the combination of C1M and VICM with an AUROC of 0.66
(P < 0.05). This suggests that the markers may have an
ability to distinguish between the two groups of lung

diseases although with relatively poor accuracy. Together
the findings indicate that the markers reflect lung pathology tissue turnover-dependent mechanisms in general,
and that these mechanisms may be more pronounced in
lung cancer (or a subgroup of lung cancers) as compared
to the other lung pathologies (IPF + COPD) tested.

The biomarker expression profiles according
to lung cancer subtype and tumor stage
Lung cancer is divided into two major subtypes which are
important in the clinical setting: SCLC and NSCLC. As
there is a trend toward increasing levels and a wider distribution of especially C1M and VICM levels in serum

from the lung cancer population, the difference in biomarker levels between the lung cancer subtypes was
assessed. When comparing SCLC and NSCLC we found
that VICM (P < 0.001) was significantly elevated in
NSCLC as compared to SCLC with an average increase of
threefold (Fig. 2A). Although no significant difference
could be detected with C1M (P = 0.142) on average a
twofold increase was seen in NSCLC as compared to
SCLC. For ELM no difference was detected. Overall, these
findings indicate that the tissue alterations assessed in this
study is more pronounced in NSCLC as compared to
SCLC. As shown in Table 2 when analyzing NSCLC versus all other patients plus the healthy controls the diagnostic power of C1M, and VICM individually were
significant with an AUROC of 0.83 and 0.84, respectively
(P < 0.0001) and when combined (C1M + VICM) with
an AUROC of 0.88 (P < 0.0001). Furthermore, NSCLC
could be discriminated from other lung pathologies; when
combining C1M and VICM an AUROC of 0.72 was
obtained (P < 0.001).
The tumor stage of disease is another important clinical tool in lung cancer cases. As illustrated in Figure 2B, no significant difference was detected between
the different tumor stages. Thus, an association between

1140

tumor stage and level of biomarkers could not be
detected in this study. Furthermore, as the markers
were elevated in all stages of the disease it may be suggested that they have potential as markers of early lung
cancer.

Diagnostic decision tree for predicting the
likelihood of having lung cancer
In an attempt to produce a model for predicting the likelihood of having lung cancer, a diagnostic decision tree
was constructed. The initial split for being lung cancer
positive was made at C1M >200 ng/mL and followed by
VICM >27.5 ng/mL. The patient distribution and statistics according to this algorithm are illustrated in Figure 3
and in Table 3. With a sensitivity of 45% and specificity
of 98%, the two markers of C1M and VICM successfully
identified a subpopulation of patients that with 90% certainty (PPV 0.9) are positive for having lung cancer. This
corresponds to 45% (18/40) of all lung cancer patient
analyzed or 13% (18/140) of the tested population. This
subgroup of patients with a high level of C1M and VICM
as defined by the cutoff values described above had an
odds ratio of 40 (95% CI 8.7–186, P < 0.0001) suggesting

probability of having lung cancer is 40 times that of not
having lung cancer.

Discussion
We measured degradation products in serum of two
ECM proteins: type I collagen (C1M) and elastin (ELM).
Furthermore, we measured degradation products of citrullinated vimentin (VICM). The biomarker targets used
in this study were identified from in vitro and ex vivo
studies and by use of mass spectrometry. The background
for choosing C1M and ELM was based on previous findings from fibrosis-related diseases of the lung (IPF and
COPD, [25]). VICM was chosen based on the role of

vimentin as a marker of EMT. VICM has also been
associated with fibrosis [24] and we speculated that it
may be linked to cancer as well.
C1M and VICM were significantly elevated in lung cancer as compared to controls and other cancer types. A
trend was detected when comparing lung cancer with
other lung pathologies. No difference could be seen for
ELM. When separating the lung cancer subtypes SCLC
and NSCLC, it was clear that the higher levels in the
markers could be associated with NSCLC and for VICM
the level in NSCLC patients was significantly higher than
any other group.
Although this study is limited by a small sample size
and lack of patient information, clearly, there seems to be
potential for the biomarkers presented to be applied in
the field of lung cancer: C1M and VICM successfully

based on defined biomarker cutoff values for C1M (200 ng/mL) and VICM (27.5 ng/mL) that were determined by calculating the mean of the
biomarker levels from all the samples measured (n = 140). Details on patient types in each of the tree branches are shown in the white boxes.

identified a subpopulation of patients with lung cancer
(Fig. 3). In addition, the markers were elevated in all
stages of the disease indicating that they may have potential as markers of early disease.
This study is the first to indicate that the release of
high levels of citrullinated fragments of vimentin (VICM)
to the circulation may be a specific signal for lung disease.
This finding is supported by the association between citrullinations and smoking and induction of inflammation
[26] and in line with cigarette smoke exposure as the
major risk factor for lung cancer. Unpublished data from
our group clearly indicate that none of the biomarkers
used in this study are influenced by smoking.
Type I collagen is present in most organs, but increased
in the stroma of neoplastic tissue leading to desmoplasia
[27, 28]. Furthermore, it is well known that an increased
production of MMP is associated with cancer. This combination may lead to a high degree of type I collagen
degradation (C1M) in concordance with our findings.

C1M together with degradation products of other collagens
have recently been found elevated in patients with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomas, a cancer characterized by
severe desmoplasia [29] and elevated levels of circulating
fragments of type I collagen have been found to be predictors of poor outcome in lung cancer [30, 31] as well as
found elevated in several other cancers such as for instance
head and neck cancer [32] and ovarian cancer [33, 34].
C1M has also previously been found elevated in COPD
and IPF patients [25], similar to our findings, indicating
that C1M may be a biomarker of several pulmonary diseases and suggesting that lessons may be learned from
research in lung fibrotic diseases such as COPD [35] and
IPF [36], which may benefit development of novel biomarkers for lung cancer (and vice versa). Pulmonary fibrosis
and lung cancer share many pathological similarities; as a
trend that is observed with lung cancer having higher levels
of C1M and VICM as compared to pulmonary fibrosis,
one might speculate that a higher degree of tissue turnover

(dynamic change) is observed in lung cancer tissue. This of
course needs validation in a future study.
Both COPD and IPF have been linked to lung cancer
and whereas studies indicate that COPD is a risk factor
for lung cancer and that COPD patients might have
underlying lung cancer [37, 38], results are somewhat
more contradictory for IPF [39]. Still, IPF have been
described as a prognostic factor in NSCLC [40] and in a
study by Nagai et al., lung cancer was found to be present
in one-third of the IPF patients analyzed [41]. We speculate that it might be possible that the two (10%) false
positive lung cancer patients from the diagnostic decision
tree (i.e., one IPF patient and one COPD patient), may
have underlying undiagnosed lung cancer.
The mechanism behind the degradation and modification of the highly complex mixture of ECM and IMF proteins is still not fully understood, however, studies
indicate that the composition of MMPs and thereby the
degradation products may differ between lung cancer subtypes [42–44]. As MMPs display diverse and sometimes
opposite effects depending on tissue localization, cellular
source, stage, and cancer subtype [45, 46] together this
may contribute, in a complex manner additional to the
complexity of the ECM and IMF status and to the differences observed between patient subtypes in this study.
Several serum-based lung cancer biomarkers are currently available in the clinical setting; however, their use
is of limited capacity and not recommended [8]. Many
proteins have been studied as potential serum-based biomarkers for lung cancer. For instance, a panel of serum
proteins (carcinoembryonic antigen, retinol-binding protein, a1-antitrypsin, and squamous cell carcinoma antigen) has been shown to be of promising value in the
clinical setting [47]. All markers are MMP driven, and
consequently they may reflect the activation or inhibition
of specific MMPs in vivo which are needed in designing
anti-MMP treatment strategies [48]. Furthermore, the
role of citrullinations and PAD enzymes in cancer has
made it relevant to test PAD inhibition as a treatment
strategy [49, 50].
In conclusion, this is the first study to test biomarkers
specifically reflecting ECM and IMF remodeling as diagnostic tools for identifying lung cancer patients. We speculate that noninvasive serum biomarkers as described,
may aid in the diagnosis and characterization of patients
with lung cancer in the future.
