Abstract

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Tobacco constituent biomarkers are metabolites of specific compounds present in tobacco or
tobacco smoke. Highly reliable analytical methods, based mainly on mass spectrometry, have been
developed for quantitation of these biomarkers in both urine and blood specimens. There is
substantial inter-individual variation in smoking-related lung cancer risk that is determined in part
by individual variability in the uptake and metabolism of tobacco smoke carcinogens. Thus, by
incorporating these biomarkers in epidemiological studies we can potentially obtain a more valid
and precise measure of in vivo carcinogen dose than by using self-reported smoking history,
ultimately improving the estimation of smoking-related lung cancer risk. Indeed, we have
demonstrated this by using a prospective study design comparing biomarker levels in urine
samples collected from smokers many years prior to their development of cancer, versus those in
their smoking counterparts without a cancer diagnosis. The following urinary metabolites were
associated with lung cancer risk, independent of smoking intensity and duration: cotinine plus its
glucuronide, a biomarker of nicotine uptake; 4-(methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanol and
its glucuronides (total NNAL), a biomarker of the tobacco carcinogen 4-(methylnitrosamino)-1-(3pyridyl)-1-butanone (NNK); and r-1-,t-2,3,c-4-tetrahydroxy-1,2,3,4-tetrahydrophenanthrene
(PheT), a biomarker of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH). These results provide several
possible new directions for using tobacco smoke constituent biomarkers in lung cancer prevention,
including improved lung cancer risk assessment, intermediate outcome determination in
prevention trials and regulation of tobacco products.

1. Introduction
The tobacco epidemic is responsible for 12% of all deaths worldwide among adults over 30
years of age and is considered the world's leading cause of preventable premature death (1).
While tobacco consumption has decreased in the U.S. since 2000 (2), worldwide tobacco
consumption has increased by 75% over the past 30 years to 7.4 million metric tons (3). It is

estimated that there are approximately 1.4 billion smokers worldwide (4). The highly
addictive nature of nicotine combined with effective exposure of susceptible target tissues to
carcinogens in tobacco smoke distinguish tobacco products from all other commodities as
the single greatest cause of cancer-related deaths.
Lung cancer is one of the most commonly diagnosed cancers, and the leading cause of
cancer death in the U.S. and worldwide (5, 6). Cigarette smoking is the most important
causal factor for lung cancer; an estimated 90% of all lung cancer deaths are attributable to
cigarette smoking (7). An estimated 11% of female smokers and 24% of male smokers may
die from lung cancer over their lifetime, assuming no competing cause of death (8).
Cigarette smoke contains 73 established animal carcinogens, 16 of which are rated as
carcinogenic to humans (9). The inter-individual variation in smoking-related lung cancer
risk may be determined in part by variability in the uptake and metabolism of tobacco smoke
carcinogens, such as 4-(methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanone (NNK), N′nitrosonornicotine (NNN) and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) (10). While there is
no doubt that exposure to these compounds is a major cause of smoking-related lung cancer,
we have little ability to predict who among the more than one billion smokers in the world
will actually get lung cancer.

This review will discuss the possible future application of tobacco smoke carcinogen and
toxicant biomarkers in lung cancer prevention, including improved lung cancer risk
assessment, intermediate outcome determination in prevention trials and regulation of
tobacco products.

2. Biomarkers Associated with Tobacco Smoking
Our group has developed and applied laboratory methods to quantify urinary tobacco
constituents and their metabolites in humans. The quantified constituents include
metabolites of nicotine, a highly addictive, non-carcinogenic compound, as well as
established carcinogens, such as tobacco-specific nitrosamines, PAH, and volatile organic
compounds (VOC). Below are brief descriptions of the specific biomarkers illustrated in
Figure 1.
2.1 Nicotine and its metabolites

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Nicotine's stimulant effect is a major contributing factor to the dependence-forming
properties of tobacco smoking. However, nicotine and its major metabolites are noncarcinogenic. Nicotine is extensively metabolized, primarily in the liver, and its major
proximate metabolite is cotinine: on average, 75% of nicotine is converted to cotinine,
primarily by the liver enzyme cytochrome P450 2A6 (CYP2A6) (11). Cotinine and cotinineN-glucuronide are metabolites of nicotine; their sum is “total cotinine”. Total cotinine is a
reliable measure of uptake of nicotine, and widely used as a biomarker of exposure to active
and passive tobacco smoking. Cotinine is further metabolized to trans-3′-hydroxycotinine
(3-HC) by the same liver enzyme CYP2A6. The in vivo half-life (t1/2) of cotinine is longer
(16 hours) than that of nicotine (2 hours) (12). Urinary cotinine concentrations average 4- to
5-fold higher than those in plasma (13), making urine a more sensitive medium for the
detection of low-level exposure to tobacco smoke and use of other nicotine-containing

products. Alternatively, urinary total nicotine equivalent, i.e., the sum of total nicotine, total
cotinine and total 3-HC, represents the uptake and metabolism of total nicotine, and
presumably a better biomarker for the consumption of cigarettes and other nicotinecontaining products.
2.2 Tobacco-specific nitrosamines
The tobacco-specific nitrosamines comprise one of the major groups of carcinogenic
chemicals in tobacco and cigarette smoke. The formation of tobacco-specific nitrosamines
occurs primarily during tobacco curing. Among the seven tobacco-specific nitrosamines
found in tobacco, NNK and NNN are considered the most carcinogenic (10). Both NNK and
NNN are classified as human carcinogens (Group I) by the International Agency for
Research on Cancer (IARC) (14).

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

NNK is a strong lung carcinogen capable of inducing lung tumors in rodents independent of
its route of administration (15). In the rat, the lowest total dose of NNK shown to induce
lung tumors was 1.8 mg/kg, with a significant dose-response trend (16). This lowest total
dose in rats is close to the estimated average uptake of 1.1 mg/kg of NNK for a heavy
smoker with 40 years of smoking (15). NNK itself is not detectable in human urine because
of its rapid and extensive metabolism to 4-(methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanone
(NNAL) and other products (15, 17).
NNAL is a major metabolite of NNK. Like NNK, NNAL is an established powerful lung
carcinogen in rats and mice, although somewhat less carcinogenic than NNK. Urinary total
NNAL, i.e., the sum of free NNAL and its glucuronides, is a well-established biomarker of
NNK uptake (10). Thus, NNAL detection in urine signifies exposure to, and uptake of, the
lung carcinogen NNK. Given that NNK is found only in tobacco products, a major
advantage of the total NNAL biomarker is its specificity to tobacco smoke exposure.
Another advantage of urinary total NNAL over other tobacco constituents for epidemiologic
studies is its relatively long half-life (i.e., 10 days to 3 weeks) (10).

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Similar to NNK, NNN is produced during curing, aging, and burning of tobacco. Human
exposure to NNN can be measured via quantitation of unchanged NNN (also called free
NNN) and its detoxification product NNN-pyridine-N-glucuronide (NNN-N-Gluc) in urine
(18). The sum of free NNN and NNN-N-Gluc in urine is referred to as total NNN.
Virtually all unburned commercial tobacco products contain NNN and NNK, and they
always occur together (14). NNN is also present in smoke from cigars and cigarettes, in the
saliva of people who chew betel quid with tobacco, and in the saliva of oral-snuff users (19).
There is great variation in levels of NNN and NNK in mainstream smoke of cigarettes. This
is mainly due to differences in tobacco types used, agricultural practices, curing methods,
and manufacturing processes (14). Levels of NNN range from 20 to 58,000 ng per cigarette
and NNK from 19 to 10,745 ng per cigarette in tobacco from commercial cigarettes sold in
different parts of the world. In mainstream smoke, the ranges of NNN and NNK were
reported from 4 to 2830 ng per cigarette and 3 to 1749 ng per cigarette, respectively (14).

A collaborative study between the World Health Organization and the U.S. Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention found that the levels of NNK plus NNN in the mainstream
smoke of Marlboro cigarettes purchased in 10 different countries were significantly higher
than local top-selling brands of cigarettes from the same countries (20). For example, the
median levels of NNK plus NNN in Marlboro cigarettes in the U.S. were very similar to the
Marlboro-brand cigarettes sold in China (i.e., 216.3 and 263.1 ng/cigarette, respectively),
whereas considerably lower median levels were reported in the local popular brands of
cigarettes in China (Hongtashan: 5.8 ng/cigarette) and India (Gold Flake: 12.4 ng/cigarette)
(20). These data suggest that differences in cancer risk among smokers, after taking into
account the number of cigarettes consumed, may be due in part to differences in NNK and
NNN uptake among smokers consuming different brands of cigarettes.
2.3 Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH)

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

PAH as a group include hundreds of chemicals that commonly occur as mixtures in the
environment. PAH are present in cigarette smoke as well as in the general environment
resulting from incomplete combustion of organic matter. Extensive investigations have
demonstrated that PAH-enriched cigarette smoke condensate fractions are carcinogenic to
mouse skin and rat lung (21, 22). Fourteen individual PAH compounds, including the widely
studied PAH benzo[a]pyrene (BaP), have been rated as having sufficient evidence for
carcinogenicity in laboratory animals, and BaP is considered carcinogenic to humans (23,
24).
We have developed and validated several biomarkers for PAH uptake and metabolism
(25-27). r-1,t-2,3,c-4-Tetrahydroxy-1,2,3,4-tetrahydrophenanthrene (PheT) is a metabolite
of phenanthrene, the simplest PAH with a bay region, a feature that is closely associated
with the carcinogenicity. 1-Hydroxyprene is a metabolite of the noncarcinogenic pyrene that
is always a component of PAH mixtures. We applied these biomarkers in smokers and
nonsmokers in epidemiological studies (28-30).
2.4 Volatile Organic Compounds

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Besides tobacco-specific nitrosamines and PAH, tobacco smoke contains a myriad of
volatile organic compounds that are toxic and some may be carcinogenic to humans. Levels
in mainstream smoke of the routinely quantified volatile organic compounds acrolein,
benzene, 1,3-butadiene, and crotonaldehyde are 100 to 1000 times greater than those of
typical PAH and NNK (28). Urinary mercapturic acids are well-established and validated
biomarkers of uptake of these compounds (shown in Figure 1), and all are found at higher
levels in the urine of smokers than in non-smokers (28, 31). Benzene, 1,3-butadiene, and
ethylene oxide are considered carcinogenic to humans by the IARC, based mainly on
occupational studies and mechanistic data related to hematopoietic malignancies (32, 33).
Acrolein is a highly toxic but marginally carcinogenic compound while crotonaldehyde is a
relatively weak hepatocarcinogen (34, 35).

cancer
Only an estimated 11% to 24% of lifelong smokers may die from lung cancer over their
lifetimes (8). This variability in susceptibility to lung cancer among smokers is due in part to
the fact that not all smokers of a given frequency of cigarette use are exposed to the same
levels of tobacco constituents. Sources of variability of the in vivo dose of tobacco smoke
carcinogens include preference for certain brands of cigarettes that contain different levels
of carcinogens, as well as differences in smoking behaviors, such as intensity of smoking,
number of puffs per cigarette, and depth of inhalation. A biomarker approach would more
directly and closely measure the internal dose to tobacco smoke constituents, therefore
potentially providing a better estimate of the risk of developing lung cancer.

Utilizing the Shanghai Cohort Study, we conducted a series of nested case-control studies to
examine the association between urinary biomarkers of cigarette smoke constituents and the
risk of developing lung cancer among current smokers. The Shanghai Cohort Study enrolled
18,244 men between January 1, 1986 and September 30, 1989 (36, 37). At enrollment all
subjects were between 45 and 64 years old and lived in one of four geographically defined
communities in the city of Shanghai, China. In-person interviews were conducted and a
urine sample was obtained from each subject upon enrollment. Cases of lung cancer were
identified annually by in-person re-interviews of all surviving cohort members and routine
review of reports from the Shanghai Cancer Registry and the Shanghai Municipal Vital
Statistics Office. For the nested case-control study, we included lung cancer patients who
smoked cigarettes at enrollment (i.e., at the time of urine collection). For each case, we
randomly selected one control subject from all cohort members who were current smokers at
enrollment, without a history of cancer, and alive at the time of cancer diagnosis of the index
case. Controls were matched to the index case by age at enrollment (±2 years), year and
month of urine collection (±1 month), and the same neighborhood of residence at
recruitment. Urine samples were retrieved from the biorepository of the cohort study and
analyzed for the following tobacco smoke carcinogen and toxicant biomarkers: total
cotinine, total NNAL, total NNN, PheT, and mercapturic acid metabolites of acrolein,
benzene, 1,3-butadiene, crotonaldehyde, and ethylene oxide. In this paper, we review of
findings from the Shanghai Cohort Study and other prospective studies for associations
between urinary metabolites of nicotine, tobacco-specific nitrosamines, PAH and volatile
organic compounds and lung cancer risk. Table 1 summarizes the main findings on these
biomarkers in relation to lung cancer from the Shanghai Cohort Study and other selected
studies with a similar design.
3.1 Nicotine Metabolites
Several epidemiologic studies, mainly using a cross-sectional or retrospective study design,
have been carried out to examine the association between plasma or urinary cotinine, a
major metabolite of nicotine, and risk of lung cancer. Among the earliest reported findings
based on prospective epidemiologic data was from a nested case-control study of 92 lung
cancer cases and 305 controls from over 26,000 women aged 40-64 living in The
Netherlands (38). The study reported an odds ratio of lung cancer for the highest tertile level

of urinary total nicotine metabolites to be 18.8 (95% CI: 8.2, 42.9), compared with those
with negative measurement of urinary nicotine and its pyridyl-containing metabolites. A
trend was observed with increasing lung cancer risk among smokers by level of urinary total
nicotine metabolites. Similar findings have since been replicated in a few prospective
epidemiological studies (39, 40).

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Based on the Shanghai Cohort Study, we conducted a nested case-control study of lung
cancer among men who were self-reported current smokers and whose urinary cotinine
levels were 35 ng/ml or higher. Our initial report among 155 lung cancer cases and 152
controls showed that current smokers with the highest tertile of urinary total cotinine (≥2615
ng/mg creatinine) had an odds ratio of 3.76 (95% confidence interval = 1.75 – 8.06) relative
to smokers with the lowest tertile of total cotinine (35 – ≤1196 ng/mg creatinine) after
adjustment for number of cigarettes per day, number of years of smoking, and urinary total
NNAL (P for trend = 0.002) (39). We expanded this initial study to include 476 lung cancer
cases and 476 controls from the same Shanghai Cohort Study and reported a similar
association between urinary total cotinine and lung cancer risk; odds ratios [95% confidence
intervals (CI)] for the 2nd and 3rd tertile of total cotinine were 2.18 (1.43-3.32) and 3.52
(2.30-5.41), respectively, compared to the lowest tertile (P for trend <0.001), also with
adjustment for smoking intensity (cigarettes per day) and duration (number of years of
smoking), and urinary total NNAL, in addition to urinary PheT (30).
In addition to the Shanghai cohort study, two nested case-control studies of lung cancer were
also conducted among current smokers. Using the Singapore Chinese Health Study dataset,
Yuan et al. conducted a nested case-control study of lung cancer (91 cases and 93 controls)
and reported a two-fold increased risk of lung cancer for the highest relative to the lowest
tertile of urinary total cotinine among current smokers, and the elevated risk diminished
slightly after adjustment for urinary total NNAL (39). In contrast, a positive association was
not observed between serum cotinine level and lung cancer risk in a nested case-control
study of lung cancer among current smokers (100 cases and 100 matched controls) that was
conducted by Church et al. utilizing the dataset of the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, and
Ovarian Cancer Screening Trial (PLCO) conducted and did not find a positive association
(41).

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

The following two nested case-control studies were conducted among both nonsmokers and
smokers. Based on the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC)
cohort, an ongoing prospective study of over 520,000 men and women between 1992 and
2000 from 10 European countries, Timofeeva et al. conducted a nested case-control study of
lung cancer including current and former smokers as well as never smokers (894 cases and
1,805 matched controls). Lung cancer risk increased monotonically with increasing serum
cotinine levels; odds ratio of lung cancer was 12.4 (95% CI: 7.1, 21.9) for subjects in the
highest decile (serum cotinine >1,800 nmol/L or >316.8 ng/mL) relative to nonsmokers
(serum cotinine <75 nmol/L or <13.2 ng/mL) after adjustment for number of cigarettes per
day (42). In a similar analysis involving 1,741 lung cancer cases and the same number of
matched controls of smokers and nonsmokers in Norway, Boffetta et al. reported a
statistically significant positive association between serum cotinine levels and lung cancer
risk in a dose-dependent manner. Compared with nonsmokers (serum cotinine <5 ng/mL or

<29 nmol/L), current smokers in the highest level of serum cotinine (>378.8 ng/mL or
>2,149 nmol/L) had an odds ratio of 55.1 (95% CI: 35.7, 85.0) of lung cancer (40). Among
those with smoking information in the analytic sample, there were 16% never, 17% former
and 67% current smokers. Compared with individuals who had serum cotinine levels ≤5
ng/mL, which included never smokers, smokers with 24.8-114.7 ng/mL of serum cotinine
(i.e., the third highest group of cotinine) had an odds ratio of 2.80 (95% CI: 1.55, 5.05) and
smokers with >378.8 ng/mL of serum cotinine (i.e., the eighth or highest group of cotinine
levels in the study) had an odds ratio of 55.1 (95% CI: 35.7, 85.0) for lung cancer. These
results were not adjusted for smoking history (e.g., status, intensity, duration) or other
biomarkers of tobacco carcinogens. It is worth pointing out that while there is no definitive
cutpoint for cotinine to separate smokers from nonsmokers (43) the most widely used
cutpoint is 14 ng/mL in serum and 50 ng/mL in urine (44).

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

A stronger association between cotinine levels and lung cancer risk observed in the studies
by Timofeeva et al. and Boffetta et al. was due to the inclusion of never smokers and former
smokers who supposedly had very low or undetectable levels of cotinine in their body fluids
given a relatively short half-life of cotinine. On the other hand, the studies by Yuan et al.(30,
39) and Church, et al. (41) included only current smokers with certain elevated levels of
cotinine in urine or serum, which resulted in a narrow range of cotinine and a flattened doseresponse relationship for cotinine and lung cancer risk. In addition, the adjustment for
smoking intensity and duration and additional biomarkers of tobacco carcinogens (e.g.,
NNAL and PheT) could further attenuate the association between cotinine and lung cancer
risk. Nonetheless, a statistically significant association between urinary total cotinine and
lung cancer risk even after adjustment for these tobacco carcinogen biomarkers (i.e, NNAL
and PheT) in the Shanghai Cohort Study (30) suggests that cotinine, while not carcinogenic,
is acting as a surrogate for other important compounds in cigarette smoke that have yet to be
characterized in terms of lung cancer risk in humans.
3.2 Total NNAL and total NNN

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

A limited number of studies have examined levels of total NNAL and risk of lung cancer in
smokers. Using the nested case-control study of lung cancer within the Shanghai Cohort
Study described above, we found that smokers who developed lung cancer had statistically
significantly higher levels of total NNAL in baseline urine samples than smokers who did
not develop lung cancer (P < 0.001). The risk of lung cancer doubled for smokers with the
highest tertile of urinary total NNAL relative to the lowest tertile after adjustment for
smoking intensity and duration and urinary total cotinine (odds ratio = 2.04; 95% CI = 1.02,
4.05; P for trend = 0.04) (39). In the follow-up study with a larger sample size (476 cases
and 476 controls) within the same Shanghai Cohort Study, we found a similar relative risk
for lung cancer associated with elevated levels of urinary total NNAL (odds ratio = 1.93;
95% CI: 1.28, 2.90) after adjustment for smoking intensity and duration, and urinary total
cotinine and PheT (30). We also conducted a case-control study nested within the Singapore
Chinese Health Study and found a similar result; the multivariate-adjusted odds ratio for
lung cancer was 2.64 (95% CI: 1.10, 6.34) for the highest tertile versus the lowest tertile of
total NNAL (39).

In a U.S.-based case-control study nested within the PLCO, total NNAL was associated with
a 1.57 times increase in lung cancer risk per standard deviation, or 40 fmol/mL (P=0.018)
(41). In this study, total NNAL, PheT and total cotinine were measured in serum collected
prior to lung cancer diagnosis among 100 cases and 100 matched controls; all of them were
current smokers consuming 10 or more cigarettes/day. The statistically significant
association for NNAL remained after adjustment for number of years of smoking, serum
cotinine and PheT.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Like NNK, NNN is produced by the nitrosation of alkaloids specific to tobacco, therefore,
NNN and NNK always occur together (14). Experimental studies have demonstrated that
NNN is a potent carcinogen to the oral cavity and esophagus, but a relatively weak
carcinogen to the lung of rats (15, 45). Utilizing the Shanghai cohort study database, we
observed no association between urinary total NNN and lung cancer risk; the odds ratios
(95% CIs) for the 2nd and 3rd tertiles of total NNN were 0.82 (0.36-1.88) and 1.02
(0.39-2.89), respectively (P for trend = 0.959), after adjustment for smoking intensity and
duration, and urinary total cotinine (46). In the same cohort, we have previously observed
and reported a strong, dose-dependent relationship between urinary NNN and esophageal
cancer risk in current smokers (47). The odds ratios (95% CIs) of esophageal cancer for the
2nd and 3rd tertiles of urinary total NNN were 3.99 (1.25-12.7) and 17.0 (3.99-72.8),
respectively, compared to the 1st tertile after adjustment for smoking intensity and duration,
and urinary total cotinine and total NNAL (P for trend <0.001). These results are strikingly
coherent with the findings of studies in F-344 rats demonstrating that NNK is a carcinogen
selective for the lung while NNN affects the esophagus and oral cavity.
3.3 PheT

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

As described above in the nested case-control study of lung cancer in current smokers within
the Shanghai Cohort Study, we quantified urinary levels of PheT in 476 lung cancer cases
and the same number of matched controls to examine if PheT levels are associated with risk
of lung cancer (30). Compared with the lowest quintile, odds ratios (95% CIs) for lung
cancer in the 2nd, 3rd, 4th, and 5th quintiles of urinary PheT were 1.70 (1.00-2.88), 1.07
(0.62-1.84), 1.48 (0.86-2.53) and 2.34 (1.33-4.11), respectively (P for trend = 0.023) after
adjustment for number of cigarettes smoked per day, number of years of smoking, and
urinary total cotinine and total NNAL. In the same cohort, we also conducted a nested casecontrol of lung cancer in lifelong nonsmokers and found a statistically significant positive
association between urinary biomarkers of PAH, including PheT, and lung cancer risk in a
dose-dependent manner (29). These results also demonstrate a role of PAH in the
development of lung cancer independent of tobacco carcinogens.
Results from the case-control study nested within the PLCO, however, do not support the
role of PAH in the development of lung cancer in smokers (41). Mean serum PheT levels
were higher in cases than controls, but the difference was not statistically significant
(P=0.204). Results from the multivariable logistic regression model also indicated a small,
but statistically non-significant association after adjustment for smoking duration, serum
total cotinine and total NNAL (odds ratio=1.23; 95% CI: 0.88, 1.72, per one standard
deviation increase in PheT). The small size of the study (100 case-control pairs), as well as

the general occurrence of PAH in the diet and the environment (as opposed to tobaccospecific compounds such as nicotine, NNK, and NNN), may have contributed to the null
results (41).
3.4 Volatile Organic Compounds
We quantified urinary mercapturic acid metabolites of acrolein, benzene, 1,3-butadiene,
crotonaldehyde, and ethylene oxide in addition to urinary biomarkers of PAH, NNK, and
nicotine in 343 lung cancer cases and 392 matched controls within the Shanghai Cohort
Study described above (48). Compared with the lowest quartiles, highest quartiles of all
measured mercapturic acids were associated with statistically significantly approximately
two-fold increased risk for lung cancer (all P's for trend <0.01) after adjustment for smoking
intensity and duration. These positive associations were completely explained by urinary
total cotinine in addition to smoking intensity and duration. Therefore, mercapturic acid
metabolites of these volatile organic compounds are not independent risk predictors of lung
cancer among male smokers in Shanghai, China.
3.5 Multivariable Model of Lung Cancer Risk Among Smokers

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

We examined the joint effect of three urinary biomarkers – total cotinine, total NNAL, and
PheT on risk of lung cancer in current smokers. For example, smokers in the highest tertiles
of urinary total NNAL and total cotinine exhibited an 8.5-fold (95% CI: 3.7, 19.5) increased
risk for lung cancer relative to smokers with comparable smoking intensity and duration but
possessing the lowest tertiles of urinary total NNAL and total cotinine (39). When we
simultaneously examined the number of cigarettes per day, number of years of smoking,
urinary total cotinine, PheT, and total NNAL in current smokers, all five variables were
statistically significantly associated with an increased risk of lung cancer (all P for trend <
0.05) (30). Odds ratios (95% CIs) for lung cancer were 1.93 (1.27-2.93) for number of packs
of cigarettes per day (20 cigarettes per pack) and 1.94 (1.52-2.47) for every 10 years of
smoking (30). Among the three urinary biomarkers, the multivariable-adjusted odds ratios
(95% CIs) for lung cancer for one unit in natural logarithmic value (an equivalent of 2.7-fold
increment) of total cotinine, total NNAL, and PheT was 1.64 (1.34-2.01), 1.28 (1.02-1.59),
and 1.41 (1.02-1.93), respectively (30). In summary, these three biomarkers were positively
associated with lung cancer risk among current smokers, independent of smoking history.

4. Discussion
The worldwide burden of lung cancer is expected to continue growing given that worldwide
consumption of tobacco continues to increase and cigarette smoking will remain the single
most important causal factor for lung cancer. However, only one quarter of deaths among
male smokers are attributed to lung cancers over their lifetime (8). Interview-based
assessment of smoking intensity and duration has limitation in capturing inter-individual
variability in uptake and metabolism of tobacco carcinogens. In this review, we have
demonstrated that appropriately chosen biomarkers would have potential to improve the
assessment of lung cancer risk over a model based solely on self-reported history of
smoking habits for current smokers.

A biomarker approach to evaluate the heterogeneity of lung cancer risk among smokers has
advantages. The measurement of the biomarker is objective and provides a direct link
between the parent compound and lung cancer risk. These biomarkers, when validated for
their direct relation with lung cancer, could be used as intermediate markers to assess the
effectiveness of cancer prevention strategies among smokers. Important among these could
be the identification of susceptible smokers at a young age, when preventive interventions
are more likely to be effective.

The strengths and limitations of a specific biomarker are also dependent on their
characteristics of being tobacco-specific (e.g., without significant non-tobacco exposure
sources), having a relatively long half-life (e.g., representative of long-term exposure),
and/or being a carcinogen or a metabolite of an established carcinogen (17). Among the four
biomarkers for which our data support being independent risk factors for cancer among
smokers, total cotinine, total NNAL, and total NNN are excellent measures of nicotine,
NNK, and NNN uptake, respectively. Given their specific source of tobacco, total cotinine
and total NNAL have been used to evaluate environmental tobacco smoke exposure in
nonsmokers (43, 49, 50). On the other hand, the PAH biomarker, PheT, could be derived
from multiple sources. PAH are ubiquitous environmental contaminants formed in all
processes involving incomplete combustion of organic matter (24, 51). The ubiquity of PAH
in the environment and their lack of tobacco specificity could contribute to the relatively
weak association between PheT and lung cancer risk in the PLCO study (41).
Of the four tobacco constituents, NNAL and its parent compound NNK as well as NNN are
carcinogenic (15). PheT is a metabolite of the non-carcinogenic PAH phenanthrene, but the
metabolism of phenanthrene to PheT closely parallels that of BaP, a strong PAH carcinogen
capable of inducing tumors of the lung and other tissues in rodents, and rated as
carcinogenic to humans (24). Cotinine is the major metabolite of nicotine, a noncarcinogenic constituent of tobacco smoke. However, each dose of nicotine delivered from a
cigarette is accompanied by at least 70 established carcinogens. Thus, nicotine and its
metabolites could be a good surrogate biomarker for the uptake of other carcinogens in
tobacco smoke for which biomarkers have yet to be developed.

A biomarker with a longer half-life has advantages over shorter-lived biomarkers in terms of
being able to capture exposures that occurred in the more distant past. NNAL has the longest
half-life (t1/2=10 days to 3 weeks) of the four biomarkers. The positive association between
total NNAL and lung cancer risk among the three study populations (30, 39, 41) support that
notion. Although cotinine is a well-established biomarker for nicotine due to its high and
frequent uptake, a well-known limitation is the inability to distinguish the source of nicotine
from non-tobacco (e.g., nicotine patch) versus tobacco products. Furthermore, the half-life
of cotinine is short compared to that of NNAL.
In summary, no single biomarker of tobacco smoke constituents stands out as the best for
stratifying smokers by risk of lung cancer. Our finding that urinary cotinine was positively
associated with lung cancer risk among smokers, after adjustment for urinary NNAL and
PheT, as well as smoking duration and intensity, supports the hypothesis that other
compounds in tobacco smoke are also likely to play a role in the development of lung cancer

in smokers. Additional research is required to develop and validate biomarkers that could be
used to predict the risk of lung cancer for smokers. An effective set of non-invasive,
predictive markers of lung cancer risk could allow the identification of the relatively small
fraction of smokers at very high risk for lung cancer. This would help to target lung cancer
screening and smoking cessation efforts to smokers at extremely high risk. The current
recommendations for lung cancer screening are for annual low-dose computed tomography
among smokers 55 to 79 years of age and with 30 or more pack-years of smoking (52).
While these screening efforts will play an important role in identifying lung tumors at their
early stage when effective treatment options are available, the high false-positive detection
rate hinders the application of this screening method to large populations of smokers (53). A
metabolite panel in addition to smoking history information may be able to reduce the false
positive rate associated with the use of CT scanning alone to identify lung tumors among
asymptomatic smokers.

A demonstrated utility of tobacco-constituent biomarkers that has not been fully explored is
their use as intermediate outcomes in chemoprevention trials among smokers. Our group and
others have contributed to the body of laboratory evidence that implicates NNK in lung
carcinogenesis in humans and 2-phenethyl isothiocyanate (PEITC) as a chemopreventive
agent against NNK-induced lung carcinogenesis (51, 54, 55) . To elucidate the potentially
causal relationship between dietary isothiocyanates (ITC) and lung cancer protection in
humans, Hecht et al. assessed the changes in urinary total NNAL in 11 cigarette smokers
following quantified consumption of watercress, a rich source of PEITC. Similar to results
in the rodent experiments (54), the consumption of watercress significantly enhanced
urinary excretion of total NNAL, indicating the activation of a possible NNK detoxification
pathway (56). Therefore, the identified biomarkers of lung cancer risk could be further
developed as intermediate markers for the evaluation of cancer prevention strategies that
involve the detoxification of NNK in smokers.

Using a biomarker-based approach to measure metabolites in human urine that reflect the in
vivo dose to tobacco smoke constituents and evaluate the relationship between metabolite
levels and lung cancer risk has important implications in public health and in setting policy
that limits the health and in setting policy that limits the contents and levels of specific
compounds in cigarettes, including nicotine and tobacco carcinogens (e.g., tobacco-specific
nitrosamines) (9, 57). The technology is certainly available to reduce these carcinogens in
tobacco products by selecting certain types of tobacco leaves and by altering the
agricultural, curing and storage processes. For example, it has been shown that levels of
NNN and NNK in selected popular brands of smokeless tobacco that were more recently
introduced into the market is about 6- and 8-fold lower than the popular traditional brands,
respectively (58). Cigarettes containing lower amounts of nicotine (i.e. 0.05 mg per
cigarette) are associated with reduced carcinogen exposure and reduced nicotine dependence
(59). In addition to establishing regulation of cigarettes that set maximum allowable toxicant
levels, additional studies are warranted to demonstrate the reduction of lung cancer risk in
smokers who consume cigarettes or other tobacco products with reduced carcinogens and
toxicants.

A relatively new product, the electronic cigarette (e-cigarette), is growing in popularity,
particularly among youths. The National Youth Tobacco Survey by the Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention found that the prevalence of e-cigarette use in high school students
in the U.S. doubled in the recent 2 to 3 years from 4.7% in 2011 to 10% in 2012 (P<0.05)
(60). Currently e-cigarettes are unregulated, although the FDA is being urged to propose
regulations that will address the advertising, ingredients and sale to minors of e-cigarettes.
E-cigarettes deliver nicotine to the user in the form of a vapor. Nicotine, although not
carcinogenic per se, often contains nornicotine as an impurity, and nornicotine is easily
converted to NNN endogenously by reaction with salivary nitrite. Previous studies have
shown large increase of urinary total NNN in individuals after they used oral nicotine
replacement therapy products such as nicotine gum or lozenge (61, 62). The rise of ecigarette use in the U.S., particularly among youths, and the potential for endogenous
formation of NNN from nicotine present in e-cigarette vapor suggest a need for future
research in which the values of urinary biomarker of tobacco-specific nitrosamines and
nicotine metabolites could be used to quantify carcinogen exposure and possibly cancer risk
associated with e-cigarette use.

In summary, the data reviewed here demonstrate that several tobacco smoke toxicant and
carcinogen biomarkers – total cotinine, total NNAL, PheT, and total NNN – are not only
biomarkers of exposure but also are biomarkers of cancer risk. Based on comparison of
smokers who eventually developed lung cancer versus their healthy counterparts, total
cotinine, total NNAL, and PheT were risk biomarkers for lung cancer while total NNN was
a risk biomarker for esophageal cancer. These results provide several possible new
directions by which tobacco smoke biomarkers could be used for lung cancer prevention.
With future research devoted to identifying additional objective biomarkers of tobacco
constituents, we hope to improve lung cancer risk assessment. Tobacco constituent
biomarkers are as intermediate endpoints in lung cancer prevention trials among smokers.
Given the long latent period for cancer development, using changes in biomarker levels, for
example, between intervention and control groups could provide results more quickly and at
less cost than waiting for cancer outcomes. Finally, the use of these and newly discovered
tobacco smoke constituent biomarkers for the purpose of establishing targets for regulation
of tobacco products is another direction that deserves emphasis in future research.
