Abstract

Extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins, such as collagen type I and elastin, and
intermediate lament (IMF) proteins, such as vimentin are modied and dys-
regulated as part of the malignant changes leading to disruption of tissue
homeostasis. Noninvasive biomarkers that reect such changes may have a great
potential for cancer. Levels of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) generated frag-
ments of type I collagen (C1M), of elastin (ELM), and of citrullinated vimentin
(VICM) were measured in serum from patients with lung cancer (n = 40), gas-
trointestinal cancer (n = 25), prostate cancer (n = 14), malignant melanoma
(n = 7), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) (n = 13), and idio-
pathic pulmonary brosis (IPF) (n = 10), as well as in age-matched controls
(n = 33). The area under the receiver operating characteristics (AUROC) was
calculated and a diagnostic decision tree generated from specic cutoff values.
C1M and VICM were signicantly elevated in lung cancer patients as compared
with healthy
cancers
(AUROC = 0.83 P < 0.0001). A trend was detected when comparing lung can-
cer with COPD+IPF. No difference could be seen for ELM. Interestingly, C1M
and VICM were able to identify patients with lung cancer with a positive pre-
dictive value of 0.9 and an odds ratio of 40 (95% CI = 8.7186, P < 0.0001).
Biomarkers specically reecting degradation of collagen type I and citrullinat-
ed vimentin are applicable for lung cancer patients. Our data indicate that
biomarkers reecting ECM and IMF protein dysregulation are highly applicable
in the lung cancer setting. We speculate that these markers may aid in diagnos-
ing and characterizing patients with lung cancer.

Introduction

Lung cancer is a signicant health issue and the leading
cause of cancer death [1, 2]. The disease is divided into
small cell lung cancer (SCLC) and nonsmall cell lung can-
cer (NSCLC), with ~8 of 10 being NSCLC.

Currently, 75% of

lung cancers are diagnosed late,
when tumors may be unresectable and treatment options
limited resulting in a 5-year survival rate of only 10% [3,
4]. No practical way of screening patients at risk of lung
cancer exists [5] and detection of
lung cancer mostly
relies on imaging modalities
computerized
tomography (CT) scans, which is not optimal [6]. Thus,

cancer are limited to monitoring [7] and no validated
molecular biomarkers for the early detection of
lung
cancer exist despite several
investigations carried out
with this purpose [8].

Tumor biology includes a complex dynamic interaction

tumor progression [9]. Consequently, biomarkers that
reect such structural changes in the tissue as a whole, and
not just tumor cell changes, may have a great potential.

Novel noninvasive molecular cancer biomarkers may be
identied by exploiting a technology based on the concept
that tumor-associated proteases and tumor signature pro-
teins, potentially combined with specic posttranslational
modications, result in release of unique protein degrada-
tion fragments to the circulation [10]. The protein frag-
ments contain pathology-specic neoepitopes that may
serve as specic cancer biomarker targets that most likely
enter the circulation by diffusing into the leaky vascula-
ture found in tumor tissue.

In lung cancer, the intermediate lament (IMF) protein
vimentin has been shown to be applicable for clinical
pathology [11]. In addition, vimentin is regarded as a
canonical marker for the epithelial-to-mesenchymal tran-
sition (EMT) [12]. Vimentin has been identied as a sur-
face and secreted protein [1315] and may be a target for
proteolytic cleavage. Furthermore, vimentin has been
shown to be a target for citrullination by peptidylarginine
deiminase (PAD) enzymes which are activated during
apoptosis and inammation [16, 17].

and

development. ECM remodeling

Extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling is another key
event in cancer [18]. The ECM integrating and surround-
ing malignant tumors is a central part of disease regula-
tion
involves
increased and altered local production of ECM proteins
(a phenomenon known as brosis or desmoplasia) as well
as increased and altered ECM degradation by upregulated
matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) activity [19]. Conse-
quently, this leads to a different composition and quality
of the ECM as compared to the normal homeostatic state
[20].

In this study, we investigated whether serum biomarkers
reecting ECM and IMF remodeling/dysregulation could
be used to differentiate lung cancer patients from healthy
controls, other lung pathologies, and other cancer types. In
detail, we measured specic protein ngerprints reecting
MMP-degradation and citrullination of vimentin, MMP-
degradation of type I collagen, the main component of the
structural interstitial ECM, and MMP-degradation of elas-
tin which provides elasticity to the lung tissue.

Material and Methods

Patient samples

After
informed consent and approval by appropriate
Institutional Review Board/Independent Ethical Commit-
tee, serum was collected from patients and age-matched
healthy controls with no symptomatic or chronic dis-
ease. Patient samples were obtained from the commer-
cial vendors Asterand (Detroit, MI) and Proteogenex
(Culver City, CA) and the healthy controls were a pool
of samples from Asterand and another study population
[21]. According to Danish law, it is not required to get
ethical approval when measuring biochemical markers in
previously collected samples; hence, there was no addi-
tional ethical approval for this particular study. Demo-
graphics and clinical proles are shown in Table 1.
Samples were all collected, processed, and stored in a
similar fashion until analyzed, and all analyses were per-
formed blindly. Patient samples were collected prior to
surgery. Tumor stage and histological type were classi-
ed according to the criteria of
the American Joint
Committee on Cancer (AJCC) and International Union
against Cancer (IUCC).

ELISA measurements and procedure

The levels of MMP-degraded type I collagen (C1M) [22],
MMP-degraded elastin (ELM) [23], and MMP-degraded
citrullinated vimentin (VICM)
[24] were assessed in
serum samples using well
characterized competitive
enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISAs). The tar-
gets were identied from in vitro and ex vivo studies and
by use of mass spectrometry and all the biomarker assays
are technically validated (see each reference for details).

times

in wash-buffer

In brief, the assays were performed by dissolving a bioti-
nylated synthetic target peptide in an optimized assay buf-
fer that was added to a 96-well streptavidin coated plate,
which then incubated for 30 min at 20C. The plate was
washed ve
(20 mmol/L Tris,
50 mmol/L NaCl, pH 7.2) prior to addition of 20 lL target
peptide calibrator or sample and 100 lL of a horseradish
peroxidase-conjugated monoclonal antibody rose against
the target peptide-sequence of interest. The plate incubated
for 12 h at 20C or overnight at 4C, depending on the
individual assay. The plate was washed ve times in wash-
buffer and nally 100 lL tetramethylbenzinidine (Kem-En-
Tec cat.438OH) was added and the plate was incubated for
15 min at 20C in dark. The reaction was stopped by add-
ing 100 lL of stopping solution (1% H2SO4) and the
OD450650nm was measured.

Statistical analysis

The levels of the individual biomarkers in serum samples
were compared using analysis of variance (ANOVA) test
with Dunnetts test to adjust for multiple comparisons or
an unpaired t-test on Log10 transformed data. Data are
presented as Tukey box plots. The area under the receiver
operating characteristics (AUROC) was calculated for
each biomarker and for the biomarkers combined. A
diagnostic decision tree was generated from specic cutoff
values and analyzed using Fishers exact probability test
and the chi-square test. Statistical analyses were per-
formed using MedCalc Statistical Software v.12 (MedCalc
Software, Ostend, Belgium) and GraphPad Prism v.6
(GraphPad Software, La Jolla, CA). Results were consid-
ered statistically signicant if P < 0.05.

Results

Extracellular matrix degradation and
citrullinated vimentin degradation in serum
from patients with various cancers and
controlslung cancer stands out

The levels of specic C1M, VICM, and ELM were mea-
sured in serum from various cancer patients and healthy
controls (Fig. 1A).

C1M was signicantly elevated in all cancer types. The
highest levels were reached in lung cancer patients with
an average increase of eightfold (P < 0.0001) when com-
pared to controls, and with the other cancer types having
a two- to threefold average increase (P < 0.05) as com-
pared to controls. Furthermore, lung cancer patients had
signicantly higher levels of C1M when compared to the
other cancer types (P < 0.050.0001).

Together, these ndings indicate that altered collagen
turnover is ongoing in cancer, with lung cancer having
the highest levels of type I collagen degradation. This
reects that alterations in the generation and degradation
of collagens and release of specic protein fragments to
the circulation are a pathological feature of cancer, espe-
cially lung cancer.

to

compared

For VICM, the levels were signicantly elevated only in
lung cancer. The average increase was approximately ten-
fold when
controls
(P < 0.0001) or the three other cancer types (P < 0.01
0.0001). This nding indicates that citrullination and
MMP-degradation of (secreted) vimentin and the release
to the circulation is associated with lung cancer only and
not other cancer types.

either

healthy

Finally, no difference in the levels of ELM could be
detected, indicating that alterations in the generation and
release of these protein fragments to the circulation are not
a pathological feature of the cancers analyzed in this study.
Next, the AUROC was calculated as a measure of the
diagnostic power of the biomarkers individually and com-
bined. This was done for all lung cancer patients versus the
healthy controls and for all lung cancers versus the other
cancer types analyzed in this study combined (GI, prostate,
and melanoma cancer) (Table 2). The results shows that
when analyzing all lung cancer patients versus healthy con-
trols the diagnostic power of C1M, and VICM individually
were highly signicant with an AUROC of 0.97 and 0.85,
respectively (P < 0.0001). The diagnostic power of ELM
was somewhat poorer with an AUROC of 0.67 (P = 0.013).
Interestingly, when combining C1M and VICM, a diagnos-
tic power of 0.98 (P < 0.0001) was achieved, indicating
that a complete discrimination between healthy controls
and lung cancer patients is obtained. When the lung cancer
patients were compared to the other cancers combined, the
markers showed promising discriminative power as well.
Here, C1M and VICM individually as well as C1M and
VICM combined were highly signicant with AUROCs of
0.81, 0.79, and 0.83, respectively (P < 0.001).

pathologies such as idiopathic pulmonary brosis (IPF)
and chronic obstructive pulmonary brosis (COPD). For
all the markers tested, no statistical difference could be
detected between lung cancer and either COPD and IPF
(Fig. 1B). However, clearly a trend toward increasing lev-
els and a wider distribution of C1M and VICM was
observed in lung cancer. Furthermore, when calculating
the AUROC with respect to lung cancer versus other lung
pathologies (i.e., IPF and COPD combined) (Table 2),
the discrimination turned out signicant for C1M alone
with an AUROC of 0.64 (P < 0.05), and for the combina-
tion of C1M and VICM with an AUROC of 0.66
(P < 0.05). This suggests that the markers may have an
ability to distinguish between the two groups of
lung

diseases although with relatively poor accuracy. Together
the ndings indicate that the markers reect lung pathol-
ogy tissue turnover-dependent mechanisms in general,
and that these mechanisms may be more pronounced in
lung cancer (or a subgroup of lung cancers) as compared
to the other lung pathologies (IPF + COPD) tested.

levels between the lung cancer

from the lung cancer population, the difference in bio-
marker
subtypes was
assessed. When comparing SCLC and NSCLC we found
that VICM (P < 0.001) was
signicantly elevated in
NSCLC as compared to SCLC with an average increase of
threefold (Fig. 2A). Although no signicant difference
could be detected with C1M (P = 0.142) on average a
twofold increase was seen in NSCLC as compared to
SCLC. For ELM no difference was detected. Overall, these
ndings indicate that the tissue alterations assessed in this
study is more pronounced in NSCLC as compared to
SCLC. As shown in Table 2 when analyzing NSCLC ver-
sus all other patients plus the healthy controls the diag-
nostic power of C1M, and VICM individually were
signicant with an AUROC of 0.83 and 0.84, respectively
(P < 0.0001) and when combined (C1M + VICM) with
an AUROC of 0.88 (P < 0.0001). Furthermore, NSCLC
could be discriminated from other lung pathologies; when
combining C1M and VICM an AUROC of 0.72 was
obtained (P < 0.001).

Diagnostic decision tree for predicting the
likelihood of having lung cancer

In an attempt to produce a model for predicting the like-
lihood of having lung cancer, a diagnostic decision tree
was constructed. The initial split for being lung cancer
positive was made at C1M >200 ng/mL and followed by
VICM >27.5 ng/mL. The patient distribution and statis-
tics according to this algorithm are illustrated in Figure 3
and in Table 3. With a sensitivity of 45% and specicity
of 98%, the two markers of C1M and VICM successfully
identied a subpopulation of patients that with 90% cer-
tainty (PPV 0.9) are positive for having lung cancer. This
corresponds to 45% (18/40) of all
lung cancer patient
analyzed or 13% (18/140) of the tested population. This
subgroup of patients with a high level of C1M and VICM
as dened by the cutoff values described above had an
odds ratio of 40 (95% CI 8.7186, P < 0.0001) suggesting

Discussion

We measured degradation products in serum of
two
ECM proteins: type I collagen (C1M) and elastin (ELM).
Furthermore, we measured degradation products of cit-
rullinated vimentin (VICM). The biomarker targets used
in this study were identied from in vitro and ex vivo
studies and by use of mass spectrometry. The background
for choosing C1M and ELM was based on previous nd-
ings from brosis-related diseases of the lung (IPF and
COPD, [25]). VICM was chosen based on the role of

vimentin as a marker of EMT. VICM has also been
associated with brosis [24] and we speculated that it
may be linked to cancer as well.

C1M and VICM were signicantly elevated in lung can-
cer as compared to controls and other cancer types. A
trend was detected when comparing lung cancer with
other lung pathologies. No difference could be seen for
ELM. When separating the lung cancer subtypes SCLC
and NSCLC,
it was clear that the higher levels in the
markers could be associated with NSCLC and for VICM
the level in NSCLC patients was signicantly higher than
any other group.

Although this study is limited by a small sample size
and lack of patient information, clearly, there seems to be
potential for the biomarkers presented to be applied in

Figure 3. Diagnostic decision tree for identifying lung cancer patients in the study current cohort. The tree (dark gray boxes) was constructed
based on dened biomarker cutoff values for C1M (200 ng/mL) and VICM (27.5 ng/mL) that were determined by calculating the mean of the
biomarker levels from all the samples measured (n = 140). Details on patient types in each of the tree branches are shown in the white boxes.
OR, Odds Ratio for having lung cancer; PPV, positive predictive value of the test. Statistical details are shown in Table 3.

identied a subpopulation of patients with lung cancer
(Fig. 3). In addition, the markers were elevated in all
stages of the disease indicating that they may have poten-
tial as markers of early disease.

This study is the rst to indicate that the release of
high levels of citrullinated fragments of vimentin (VICM)
to the circulation may be a specic signal for lung disease.
This nding is supported by the association between cit-
rullinations and smoking and induction of inammation
[26] and in line with cigarette smoke exposure as the
major risk factor for lung cancer. Unpublished data from
our group clearly indicate that none of the biomarkers
used in this study are inuenced by smoking.

Type I collagen is present in most organs, but increased
in the stroma of neoplastic tissue leading to desmoplasia
[27, 28]. Furthermore, it is well known that an increased
production of MMP is associated with cancer. This combi-
nation may lead to a high degree of type I collagen
degradation (C1M) in concordance with our ndings.

C1M together with degradation products of other collagens
have recently been found elevated in patients with pancre-
atic ductal adenocarcinomas, a cancer characterized by
severe desmoplasia [29] and elevated levels of circulating
fragments of type I collagen have been found to be predic-
tors of poor outcome in lung cancer [30, 31] as well as
found elevated in several other cancers such as for instance
head and neck cancer [32] and ovarian cancer [33, 34].
C1M has also previously been found elevated in COPD
and IPF patients [25], similar to our ndings, indicating
that C1M may be a biomarker of several pulmonary dis-
eases and suggesting that lessons may be learned from
research in lung brotic diseases such as COPD [35] and
IPF [36], which may benet development of novel biomar-
kers for lung cancer (and vice versa). Pulmonary brosis
and lung cancer share many pathological similarities; as a
trend that is observed with lung cancer having higher levels
of C1M and VICM as compared to pulmonary brosis,
one might speculate that a higher degree of tissue turnover

(dynamic change) is observed in lung cancer tissue. This of
course needs validation in a future study.

Both COPD and IPF have been linked to lung cancer
and whereas studies indicate that COPD is a risk factor
for lung cancer and that COPD patients might have
underlying lung cancer [37, 38], results are somewhat
more contradictory for IPF [39]. Still, IPF have been
described as a prognostic factor in NSCLC [40] and in a
study by Nagai et al., lung cancer was found to be present
in one-third of the IPF patients analyzed [41]. We specu-
late that it might be possible that the two (10%) false
positive lung cancer patients from the diagnostic decision
tree (i.e., one IPF patient and one COPD patient), may
have underlying undiagnosed lung cancer.

is

still not

fully understood, however,

The mechanism behind the degradation and modica-
tion of the highly complex mixture of ECM and IMF pro-
teins
studies
indicate that the composition of MMPs and thereby the
degradation products may differ between lung cancer sub-
types [4244]. As MMPs display diverse and sometimes
opposite effects depending on tissue localization, cellular
source, stage, and cancer subtype [45, 46] together this
may contribute, in a complex manner additional to the
complexity of the ECM and IMF status and to the differ-
ences observed between patient subtypes in this study.

Several serum-based lung cancer biomarkers are cur-
rently available in the clinical setting; however, their use
is of limited capacity and not recommended [8]. Many
proteins have been studied as potential serum-based bio-
markers for lung cancer. For instance, a panel of serum
proteins (carcinoembryonic antigen, retinol-binding pro-
tein, a1-antitrypsin, and squamous cell carcinoma anti-
gen) has been shown to be of promising value in the
clinical setting [47]. All markers are MMP driven, and
consequently they may reect the activation or inhibition
of specic MMPs in vivo which are needed in designing
anti-MMP treatment strategies [48]. Furthermore,
the
role of citrullinations and PAD enzymes in cancer has
made it relevant to test PAD inhibition as a treatment
strategy [49, 50].

In conclusion, this is the rst study to test biomarkers
specically reecting ECM and IMF remodeling as diag-
nostic tools for identifying lung cancer patients. We spec-
ulate that noninvasive serum biomarkers as described,
may aid in the diagnosis and characterization of patients
with lung cancer in the future.
