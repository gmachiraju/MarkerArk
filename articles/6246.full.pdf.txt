Abstract Purpose:This study aims to explore the presence of informative protein biomarkers in the human
saliva proteome and to evaluate their potential for detection of oral squamous cell carcinoma
(OSCC).
Experimental Design: Whole saliva samples were collected from patients (n = 64) with OSCC
and matched healthy subjects (n = 64). The proteins in pooled whole saliva samples of
patients with OSCC (n = 16) and matched healthy subjects (n = 16) were profiled using shotgun
proteomics based on C4 reversed-phase liquid chromatography for prefractionation, capillary
reversed-phase liquid chromatography with quadruple time-of-flight mass spectrometry, and
Mascot sequence database searching. Immunoassays were used for validation of the candidate
biomarkers on a new group of OSCC (n = 48) and matched healthy subjects (n = 48). Receiver
operating characteristic analysis was exploited to evaluate the diagnostic value of discovered
candidate biomarkers for OSCC.
Results: Subtractive proteomics revealed several salivary proteins at differential levels between
the OSCC patients and matched control subjects. Five candidate biomarkers were successfully
validated using immunoassays on an independent set of OSCC patients and matched
healthy subjects. The combination of these candidate biomarkers yielded a receiver operating
characteristic value of 93%, sensitivity of 90%, and specificity of 83% in detecting OSCC.
Conclusion: Patient-based saliva proteomics is a promising approach to searching for
OSCC biomarkers. The discovery of these new targets may lead to a simple clinical tool for the
noninvasive diagnosis of oral cancer. Long-term longitudinal studies with large populations of
individuals with oral cancer and those who are at high risk of developing oral cancer are needed
to validate these potential biomarkers.

Oral cancer, predominantly oral squamous cell carcinoma
(OSCC), is a high-effect local disease in the oral cavity affecting
over 300,000 people worldwide annually (1, 2). The American
Cancer Society estimated that more than 30,000 new cases of
oral cancer were diagnosed in 2006, representing f3% of all
malignancies in men and 2% of all malignancies in women (3).

Patients with OSCC often present with symptoms at a late
stage, and there is a high recurrence rate after treatment,
especially in those with neck lymph node metastasis. The
overall 5-year survival rates for oral cancer have remained low
and are essentially unchanged during the past few decades (4,
5). Delayed detection is likely to be a primary reason for the
high morbidity rate of oral cancer patients, and this supports
the imperative need for sensitive biomarkers to improve early
detection of oral cancers.

Currently, oral cancer diagnosis depends on a thorough oral
examination, usually by a dentist or other qualified health
care provider, for possible signs and symptoms of the disease.
If an exam shows an abnormal area in the oral cavity, a small
tissue biopsy may be removed for a pathologist to check
for cancer cells under a microscope. Scientists are searching
for biomarkers in saliva, an easy-to-obtain body fluid, for
noninvasive detection of oral cancer. For instance, mitochon-
drial DNA mutation and aberrant promoter hypermethylation
of cancer-related genes are common in head and neck/oral
cancer. Detection of these genetic alterations in saliva may be
useful for diagnosis and monitoring of the disease (6  9). We
have identified seven salivary mRNAs that can discriminate
OSCCs from matched control subjects (10). Validation of this
set of signature on a large patient population is currently
being done in a multicenter trial. Last, several studies have
investigated the use of salivary proteins as potential diagnostic
markers for oral cancer (11  14). Elevated levels of salivary

Translational Relevance

By using patient-based saliva proteomics, this study has
shown that informative protein biomarkers are present in
oral cancer patients saliva that can be used for potential
detection of the disease. Because it is very simple to collect
and process saliva fluids, the discovery of these biomarkers
may lead to a useful clinical tool for noninvasive diagnosis
of oral cancer in the future. Large-scale clinical trials are
needed for further testing those potential biomarkers
on new populations of individuals with oral cancer and
those who are at high risk for developing oral cancer. Novel
diagnostic devices will also be developed for fast
and high-throughput measurement of these biomarkers in
cancer patients saliva.

soluble CD44 were shown in the majority of OSCC and could
distinguish cancer from benign disease with high specificity
(11). Three tumor markers, cytokeratin 19 fragment Cyfra21-
1, tissue polypeptide antigen, and cancer antigen 125, were
found significantly elevated in the saliva of OSCC patients,
and combined use of
these markers resulted in similar
diagnostic value to those obtained when measuring them in
the sera of OSCC patients (12). The level of p53 autoantibody
in saliva was also found correlated with its serum levels in
OSCC and analysis of p53 antibody in saliva may offer a
specific method for detection of a subset of OSCC with p53
aberrations (13). Considering that these candidate biomarkers
were discovered at an individual basis, their predicting power
for OSCC detection is limited. Our study is aimed for the
identification of a panel of candidate biomarkers, which may
collectively improve the sensitivity and specificity for detecting
OSCC.

The purpose of this present study is to discover and validate
differentially expressed proteins in saliva from patients with
OSCC that could serve as potential biomarkers for OSCC
detection. By using a subtractive proteomics approach to profile
salivary proteins from oral cancer and matched healthy subjects
followed by immunoassay validation, we have revealed a
panel of candidate protein biomarkers for potential detection
of OSCC.

Materials and Methods

Patients and saliva samples.

In total, 128 participants, including
64 OSCC patients and 64 control subjects, were recruited for this study.
The cancer and control groups were completely matched in terms of
gender (P = 1) and ethnicity (P = 1). The mean ages for OSCC patients
and healthy controls were 54.0 and 46.9 y (P = 0.006, Students t test),
respectively. The sex distribution in OSCC or control groups was 20:44
(female:male), and the smoking history was matched by determining
the pack per year history (P = 0.65). All of the OSCC patients were
recently diagnosed and had not received any prior treatment in the
form of chemotherapy, radiotherapy, surgery, or alternative remedies
before sample collection. All the subjects involved in this study signed
the institutional review board  approved consent form. None of these
subjects had a history of prior malignancy,
immunodeficiency,
autoimmune disorders, hepatitis, or HIV infection.

Salivary Protein Markers of OSCC

A well-defined and standardized protocol was used for collection,
storage, and processing of all the samples under the exactly same
conditions. Unstimulated whole saliva (WS) samples were collected
between 9 a.m. and 10 a.m. with prior mouth rinsing with water (15).
The donors were asked to abstain from eating, drinking, smoking, or
using oral hygiene products for at
least 1 h before collection.

The samples, once collected, were centrifuged at 2,600  g for 15
min at 4jC to remove debris and cells. The supernatant was then
removed and protease inhibitors were included in the collected samples
to ensure preservation of the protein integrity. The samples were
immediately aliquoted into smaller volumes and stored at -80jC.
To avoid the effects of protein degradation, the samples that had been
thawed were not reused.

Shotgun proteome analysis. Shotgun proteomics based on reversed-
phase liquid chromatography (LC) off-line prefractionation of intact
proteins and subsequent LC-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS)
analysis of proteolyzed peptides was used for profiling of saliva
proteins from OSCC or matched control subjects. The total protein
concentration in each sample was measured using a 2D Quant kit
(GE Healthcare). We then pooled equal amount of WS proteins from
16 OSCC patients or 16 control subjects, respectively,
for the
comparative analysis.

Both pooled OSCC and control samples (100 Ag proteins in total
each) were separated by LC (HP1100, Agilent Technologies) using a
Vydac C4 RP column (particle size, 5 Am; 250  2.1 mm inner
diameter; The Nest Group, Inc.) at a flow rate of 250 AL/min. This
allowed for 35 fractions collected from each pooled sample (1 fraction
per minute). The proteins in each fraction were reduced with DTT
(10 mmol/L, 1 h), alkylated with iodoacetamide (55 mmol/L, 1 h),
and digested by trypsin (60 ng trypsin for each fraction) at 37jC for
overnight. The resulting peptide digests were dried, reconstituted in
0.1% formic acid, and then analyzed by online capillary LC-quadruple
time-of-flight (QqTOF) MS.

LC-MS/MS analysis was done using a LC Packings nano-LC system
(Dionex) with a nanoelectrospray interface (Protana) and QqTOF mass
spectrometer (QSTAR XL, Applied Biosystems). A New Objective
PicoTip tip (inner diameter, 8 mm) was used for electrospraying with
the voltage at 1,850 V for online MS and MS/MS analyses. The samples

were first loaded onto a home-packed C18 precolumn (300 Am 
1 mm; particle size, 5 Am) and then injected onto a LC Packings
PepMap C18 column (75 Am  150 mm; particle size, 5 Am) for

nano-LC separation at a flow rate of 250 nL/min.

Identification of the peptides and represented proteins was realized
by using the Mascot database search engine (version 1.9; Matrix
Science). All searches were done against the EBI human IPI database
(version 2.0.1). In all searches, one missed tryptic cleavage was allowed,
and a mass tolerance of 0.3 Da was set for the precursor and product
ions. A Mascot score of >25 with P < 0.05 was considered a significant
match. False-positive rates were determined using the method described
in the Mascot manual. Briefly, false-positive rate was calculated by
multiplying the number of false-positive identifications (hits to the
decoy database constructed from randomized sequences) and dividing
by the number of total identifications. The estimated false-positive rate
was determined to be 2% or less.

Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis. Two-dimensional gel electro-
phoresis (2-DE) with Sypro-Ruby staining was used to map out the
proteins in the same pooled saliva samples from either OSCC (n = 16)
or matched control subjects (n = 16). The proteins in both samples
were precipitated by cold ethanol at -20jC for overnight. Following
centrifugation at 14,000  g for 20 min, the supernatants were removed
and the pellets were washed with cold ethanol and then collected for
total protein assay using a 2D Quant kit (Amersham). Briefly, 100 Ag of
total proteins from each pooled samples were used for comparative
2-DE analysis. Isoelectric focusing was done using immobilized pH
gradient strips (11-cm long, pI 3  10 NL; Bio-Rad) on a Protean
isoelectric focusing cell (Bio-Rad), and SDS-PAGE was done in 8% to
16% precast gels on a Criterion Dodeca Cell (Bio-Rad). Fluorescent

Sypro-Ruby stain (Molecular Probes-Invitrogen) was used to visualize
protein spots.

Gel images were acquired and analyzed using PDQuest software
(Bio-Rad). Initially, the images were filtered to remove small noise
features without affecting the protein spot. After normalization of spot
signals based on the total gel density, a matched set was created
between the two-dimensional gel image of the OSCC and control
samples. Protein spots were automatically detected and matched and
subsequently manually reviewed. Finally, the relative levels of protein
spots between the disease and control patients were determined.

Immunoassays. ELISAs were done to determine the levels of s90K/
Mac-2 binding protein (M2BP; IBL-Hamburg), histone H1 (ALPCO
Diagnostics), and S100A9 and S100P (CycLex Co.) in saliva samples
from OSCC and matched control subjects. Samples were analyzed, in
duplicate, and the protein levels were determined according to
calibration curves established from standards.

Immunoblotting was also done to compare the protein levels
between OSCC and matched control subjects. The antibodies used
included MRP14 (S100A9), profilin (Cell Signaling), CD59 (Abcam),
catalase (Abcam), Ras-related protein Rab-7 (Lab Vision), hematopoi-
etic lineage cell  specific protein (Novus Biologicals, Polyclonal) and
moesin (Abcam). Saliva samples from equal numbers of OSCC and
control subjects were separated on a 4% to 12% NuPAGE gel
(Invitrogen) at 150 V and then transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride
membranes using an Invitrogen iBLOT transfer module. After saturating
with 5% milk in TBS-Tween 20 buffer overnight at 4jC, the blots were
sequentially incubated with primary antibody and horseradish perox-
idase  conjugated IgG secondary antibody (Amersham). Finally, the
bands were detected by enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham)
and quantified using the Scion Imaging software. Immunoblotting of
actin in OSCC and control subjects was also done for normalization of
densitometric signals.

Statistical analysis. The Western blotting data for MRP14, CD59,
profilin, and catalase were normalized against the corresponding actin
levels from the same samples. The normalized values for MRP14,
CD59, profilin, and catalase as well as the ELISA data for M2BP were
used for further analysis. The reported P values were based on a
nonparametric test using the Wilcoxon rank sum test.

We built a logistic regression model and conducted receiver
operating characteristic (ROC) curve analyses to evaluate overall
predictive power of the combined five candidate protein biomarkers
(M2BP, MRP14, CD59, profilin, and catalase). The optimal cut point
was determined for each biomarker by identifying the value that yielded
the maximum corresponding sensitivity and specificity. ROC curves
were then plotted based on the set of optimal sensitivity and specificity
values. Area under the curve was computed via numerical integration of
the ROC curves. All statistical data analysis was done using the
statistical software package R 2.5.0.

We used leave-one-out cross-validation to validate the logistic
regression model. The cross-validation strategy first removes one
observation and then fits a logistic regression model
from the
remaining cases with all of the markers. Stepwise model selection is
used for each of these models to remove variables that do not improve
the model. Subsequently, we used the marker values for the case that
was left out to compute a predicted class for that observation. The cross-
validation error rate is then the number of samples predicted incorrectly
divided by the number of samples.

Results

To discover target proteins that can serve as potential markers
for OSCC detection, we used a subtractive proteomics approach
to profile proteins in pooled saliva samples from 16 OSCC and
16 healthy subjects. These cancer patients and healthy control
subjects were very well matched in terms of gender (P = 1),
ethnicity (P = 1), and age (P = 0.94) to minimize potential bias

from these factors during the discovery phase. The total protein
concentrations for each group were determined as 1.01 F 0.43
mg/mL (OSCC, n = 16) and 1.07 F 0.59 mg/mL (control,
n = 16; P = 0.74). Both pooled samples were initially
prefractionated using reversed-phase LC, and subsequent in-
solution tryptic digestion with LC-MS/MS of
the resulting
peptides allowed the identification of proteins in each collected
fraction. As shown in Fig. 1A, the C4-LC profiles of intact saliva
proteins from OSCC and healthy subjects are remarkably
similar. We repeated the analysis of collected protein fractions
using the same method and combined the searched results. In
total, we identified 461 and 438 nonredundant proteins from
both pooled samples, respectively,
for OSCC and control
samples and as shown in Fig. 1B. Most proteins (n = 409)
overlap between the disease and control samples. However,
52 proteins were found to be present in OSCC but are absent in
the healthy control subjects (Supplementary Table S1), whereas
29 proteins were found only in the healthy subjects but absent
in OSCC patients (Supplementary Table S2). The proteins listed
in both tables were all verified manually by examining the raw
MS/MS spectra. Because our shotgun proteome analysis was
done on the pooled cancer and control samples instead of the
samples from individual subjects, we did not have the statistics
for the spectral counting data. Some of the listed proteins were
identified based on a single-peptide assignment. However, this
study was based on accurate QqTOF MS analysis. Tandem mass
spectra of peptides were obtained with better than 50 ppm
mass accuracy and resolution routinely in excess of 5,000,
providing very confident
identification of proteins. Never-
theless,
these protein identifications need to be verified.
We tested four proteins (CD59, involucrin, Ras-related protein
Rab-7, and moesin) with single-peptide assignment. Their
presence in OSCC saliva was all confirmed by immunoassays.
As a comparison,
the same pooled samples from OSCCs
and matched controls were also profiled with 2-DE and
remarkably similar patterns were observed (Fig. 1C). It has
been challenging to produce decent
two-dimensional gel
patterns of WS proteins because WS contains amylase and
immunoglobulins at extremely high abundance, which are very
difficult to deplete.

Among the large number of proteins that we found present in
both OSCC and healthy subjects, many of them are differen-
tially expressed as reflected by the differential number of MS/
MS spectra (spectrum counting) observed from the shotgun
proteomic analysis (Supplementary Table S3). For instance,
MRP14 is a calcium-binding protein that has been implicated
in different types of human cancers. From the two repeated
analyses, 66 MS/MS spectra were observed for this specific
protein in OSCCs, whereas only 18 MS/MS spectra were
observed in healthy subjects. Further validation of MRP14 in a
new patient cohort (n = 48 OSCCs; n = 48 controls) by
immunoblotting confirmed that this protein is significantly
overexpressed in saliva of patients with OSCC (Table 1).
Conversely, polymeric-immunoglobulin receptor (PIGR; also
known as hepatocellular carcinoma  associated protein TB6) is
down-regulated in OSCC as reflected by the 24 MS/MS spectra
observed in OSCC but 49 MS/MS spectra observed in healthy
subjects. We were unable to validate this protein with immu-
noassay due to unavailability of a commercial antibody. How-
ever, down-regulation of PIGR in OSCC patients compared
with healthy control subjects was verified by two-dimensional

glycosylated and exhibited a 2.1-fold decrease in OSCC
patients.

Twelve candidates showing up-regulated levels in OSCC
(Supplementary Tables S1 and S2) were chosen for further
validation because antibodies and ELISA assays for these
proteins are commercially available. Table 1 summarizes the
validation results between OSCC and matched controls for
these proteins. ELISA was used for validation of M2BP,
involucrin, histone H1, S100A12, and S100P, whereas immu-
noblotting was used for validation of eight other proteins,
including MRP14, CD59, catalase, profilin, moesin, hemato-
poietic lineage cell-specific protein, and Ras-related protein
Rab-7. Actin was used for normalization of densitometric
signals in immunoblotting. Among these proteins, five poten-
tial biomarkers showed significant differences (P V 0.006)
between OSCC (n = 48) and matched healthy cohorts (n = 48).

Discussion

Oral carcinogenesis arises through a series of histopathologic
stages from benign hyperplasia to dysplasia to carcinoma in situ
followed by invasive squamous cell carcinoma. At
the
molecular level, the development of OSCC is a multistep
process accompanied by genetic mutations and expression
changes of many genes that
lead to uncontrolled cellular
growth (16, 17). The cellular and molecular heterogeneity of
OSCC and the large number of genes potentially involved in
oral carcinogenesis emphasize the importance of studying gene
expression changes in a global scale by proteomics. This also
suggested that multiple proteins (pathways) should be simul-
taneously targeted as an effective strategy to diagnose or treat
the disease.

Imaging, Diagnosis, Prognosis

Because oral cancer cells are immersed in the salivary milieu,
the salivary proteomes from OSCC patients
analysis of
represents a potentially promising approach to finding poten-
tial biomarkers for the disease. Saliva is an easily accessible
fluid compared with tissue biopsies. Therefore, a large number
of saliva samples can be collected and analyzed, and this
should allow for a robust study design with sufficient statistical
power to reveal true signatures characteristic of the disease.
Furthermore, the identified protein biomarkers can be trans-
lated into simple clinical assays, allowing the disease to be
detected or monitored in a noninvasive body fluid. We have
done in-depth analysis of the human salivary proteome using a
combination of different separation techniques combined with
QqTOF MS (18  20), and the data from WS have been
deposited into the Saliva Proteome Knowledge Base for public
access. We have also identified 84 N-glycosylated peptides
representing 45 unique N-glycoproteins in WS using hydrazide
chemistry and LC-MS/MS analysis of N-glycosylated peptides
selectively released from the captured glycoproteins (21). In
addition, a 3-year effort by the Human Salivary Proteome
Project, a consortium of three research groups including the
Scripps Research Institute/University of Rochester, the Univer-
sity of California-San Francisco, and the University of
California-Los Angeles/University of Southern California, has
led to the identification of over 1,100 nonredundant proteins
in human parotid and submandibular/sublingual secretions
(22). With the successful compilation of the saliva proteome, a
next step would be to identify potential diagnostic and/or
prognostic biomarkers that could be used in a clinical context
for disease detection and monitoring in saliva. For example,
saliva proteome analysis of patients with primary Sjo grens
syndrome (pSS) has suggested that pSS is associated with
increased inflammatory proteins and decreased acinar proteins
in saliva when compared with non-SS (23, 24). Current
diagnosis of pSS requires salivary gland biopsy. However, if
these newly discovered targets are successfully validated, a
noninvasive diagnosis of pSS based on salivary biomarkers will
be possible in the future.

Subtractive proteomics refers to direct profiling of proteins
expressed in samples from two cellular or pathologic states
using multidimensional LC separation and data-dependent
MS/MS analysis (25, 26). This method does not use gels or

stable isotopes but simply quantifies proteins by counting the
number of MS/MS spectra for the tryptic peptides identified for
each proteins (27, 28). The quantitative measurement
is
because the number of MS/MS spectra of tryptic peptides
identified for a given protein is correlated to its relative
abundance in the sample. Although subtractive proteomics is
imprecise compared with other quantitative MS such as stable
isotope labeling methods,
this approach is attractive for
biomarker discovery mainly because of its inherent simplicity.
Very little sample preparation before MS analysis is required,
with no covalent labeling involved (29). Our study suggests
that subtractive proteomics is a more feasible approach than 2-
DE/MS in terms of revealing the OSCC-associated saliva
proteins at differential levels. As shown in Fig. 1C, remarkably
similar patterns between OSCC and control subjects were
observed, although some faint protein spots showed differen-
tial
levels. The high abundance of salivary amylase and
immunoglobulins undermined the analysis of low-abundance
proteins in WS. Both glycogen precipitation and antibody
binding were tested in our study to deplete amylase; however,
the efficiency was low and depletion of many other proteins
occurred as well (data not shown). On the contrary,
the
subtractive proteomics approach allowed the identification of
many low-abundance proteins at differential levels and seems
to be a more rational approach than 2-DE/MS for discovery of
salivary protein biomarkers of human diseases.

Many proteins at elevated levels in OSCC patients saliva
(Supplementary Tables S1 and S3) have been previously
associated with human cancers (e.g., squamous cell carcinoma
antigen 2, calcyclin, Rho GDP dissociation inhibitor, heat
shock 70-kDa protein 1, Annexin I, cathepsin G, peroxiredoxin
II, thioredoxin, short palate, and lung and nasal epithelium
carcinoma-associated protein; refs. 30  34). Apart from poten-
tial clinical applications, these target proteins may contribute to
an understanding of the molecular mechanism of the disease.
Meanwhile, some of the salivary proteins were underexpressed
in OSCC (Supplementary Tables S2 and S3). For instance,
clusterin was found present in control but absent in OSCC by
subtractive proteomic analysis. This secretory protein is involved
in programmed cell death (apoptosis; ref. 35), and down-
regulation of clusterin in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma
and prostate cancer has been reported in previous studies (36, 37).

Salivary Protein Markers of OSCC

Fig. 2. A, validation of five candidate biomarkers (M2BP, MRP14, CD59, catalase, and profilin) between OSCC (n = 48) and matched control (n = 48) subjects.
MRP14, CD59, catalase, and profilin were measured by Western blotting and normalized against corresponding actin levels, whereas M2BP was measured with ELISA
(Ag/mL). B, ROC analysis based on the validation results of these five candidate markers. The area under the curve (AUC) was determined as 0.93. The sensitivity
and specificity were 90% and 83%, respectively.

Obviously, the candidates discovered by subtractive proteo-
mics need to be further validated. From the overexpressed
proteins in OSCC, we chose 12 candidates that have commer-
cially available antibodies or ELISA assays for further validation
(Table 1). Six candidates (50%) were validatable based on the
immunoassays, including M2BP, a tumor antigen (38  40). In a
previous study using cancer cell  secreted proteomes as a basis
for searching potential
tumor markers, M2BP was found
significantly up-regulated in nasopharyngeal carcinoma. The
serum levels of M2BP were also significantly higher in both
nasopharyngeal carcinoma patients and nasopharyngeal carci-
noma nude mice model compared with healthy people or
tumor-free mice (41). Other successfully validated proteins
included MRP14, CD59, profilin 1, and catalase. An increased
level of MRP14 has been previously reported in tissue cells of oral
tongue cancer (42). CD59 (protectin) is one of the complement
restriction factors that are overexpressed on tumor cells, and they
enable tumor cells to escape from complement-dependent and
antibody-mediated killing (43). Profilin 1 is a regulator of the
microfilament system and is involved in various signaling
pathways via interactions with cytoplasmic and nuclear ligands.
It may be secreted into tumor microenvironments during the
early progressive stage of tumor formation (44). Finally, catalase
protects the cell against oxidative stress, and altered levels of
catalase (as well as other antioxidative enzymes such as
superoxide dismutase and glutathione peroxidase) are evident
in many human tumors and are fundamentally involved in
carcinogenesis and tumor progression (45).

OSCC is a complex disease resulting from an interdependent
series of genetic alterations rather than a single decisive event.
Therefore, combination of these candidate protein markers can
improve the sensitivity and specificity for OSCC detection. ROC
analysis indicates that
the five candidate markers (M2BP,
MRP14, CD59, catalase, and profilin), collectively, provide a

sensitivity of 90% and a specificity of 83% for OSCC detection,
with a ROC value (area under the curve) of 0.93 (Fig. 2B). The
total accuracy was determined as 85% through a leave-one-out
cross-validation approach.

In summary, our study has shown that patient-based saliva
proteomics is a promising approach to discovery of biomarkers
for oral cancer detection. However, at this stage, we have only
verified that the results obtained by shotgun proteomics are true
findings. The discovered candidate biomarkers need to be
extensively validated considering that the sampling efficiency
for LC-MS/MS might vary from one experiment to another and
some of the targets were identified based on single-peptide
assignment. Clearly, it is challenging to translate candidate
biomarkers from proteomic investigations into real-world
diagnostic or prognostic applications. Approval of use of a
biomarker or set of biomarkers for a given clinical decision relies
on the results of large-scale multicenter clinical trials, and
approval of the use of the detection technology for that purpose.
The successful completion of biomarker development requires
adherence to guidelines set forth by the Early Detection Research
Network, which was established by the National Cancer Institute
in response to the recent development of emerging technologies
(e.g., proteomics and microarrays) for cancer screening (46, 47).
We are currently working with the National Cancer Institute/Early
Detection Research Network designated Biomarker Reference
Lab laboratory at the University of California at Los Angeles to
validate the identified protein biomarkers and test if
the
combination of these biomarkers with our previously discovered
mRNA biomarkers can further improve the detection of OSCC.
The appropriate application of a biomarker in clinics can also be
aided by novel diagnostic devices (e.g., microfluidics-based
chips) for simple and high-throughput measurement of the
biomarker in patients saliva (48, 49). If appropriately validated
on larger patient cohorts, testing of the discovered candidate

markers coupled with microfluidic devices may become a
powerful tool for oral cancer diagnosis in the future. The biology
behind these promising targets should also be well studied to
understand the mechanism in a clinical setting. Lastly, OSCC is
usually detected at late stages when the cancer has advanced and
therefore results in poor prognosis and survival. It is therefore
critical to detect oral cancer as early as possible, when it can be
treated more successfully, and thus enhancing the rate of
survival. Considering that f10% of the general population
have oral mucosal abnormalities, and precancerous and early
cancerous lesions rarely show distinct clinical characteristics,

there is a growing realization that some premalignant and early
cancerous lesions are not readily detectable by visual inspection
(50). Therefore, the integration of early detection and screening
based on protein biomarkers, in conjunction with a conven-
tional oral examination,
is very important. This warrants
retrospective proteomic analyses of oral precancer and cancer
to achieve discriminatory biomarkers for true early detection.
