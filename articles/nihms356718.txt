Abstract

Keywords

The goal of effective population-based screening for ovarian cancer remains elusive despite
intense efforts aimed at improving upon biomarker and imaging modalities. While dozens of
potential serum biomarkers for ovarian cancer have been identified in recent years, none have yet
overcome the limitations that have hindered the clinical use of CA-125. Avenues of opportunity in
biomarker development are emerging as investigators are beginning to appreciate the significance
of remote, as well as local or regional, sources of biomarkers in the construction of diagnostic
panels, as well as the importance of evaluating biomarkers in prediagnostic settings. As the list of
candidate biomarkers of ovarian cancer continues to grow, refinements in the methods through
which specific proteins are selected for further development as components of diagnostic panels
are desperately sought. Such refinements must take into account both the bioinformatic and
biological significance of each candidate. Approaches incorporating these considerations may
potentially overcome the challenges to early detection posed by the histological heterogeneity of
ovarian cancer. Here, we review the recent progress achieved in efforts to develop diagnostic
biomarker panels for ovarian cancer and discuss the challenges that remain.

Ovarian cancer represents the eighth most common cancer among women and the second
most frequently diagnosed gynecological malignancy in the USA and Europe [1]. The
overall mortality attributed to ovarian cancer exceeds that of any other gynecological cancer
with over 50% of the 200,000 women or more newly diagnosed each year worldwide

expected to perish from the disease [201]. A critical factor in the elevated mortality
associated with ovarian cancer is the lack of disease-specific symptoms. This difficulty is
underscored in a joint recommendation recently issued by a high-profile consortium of
public health organizations termed the Ovarian Cancer Symptom Index, which listed
bloating, pelvic or abdominal pain, difficulty eating/fullness and urinary symptoms as those
more likely to occur in ovarian cancer patients than healthy women [2]. Compounding the
problem of ubiquitous clinical presentation is the observation that the majority of early-stage
cancers are asymptomatic, resulting in over three-quarters of all diagnoses being made at a
time when the disease has already established regional or distant metastases [3]. Despite
aggressive cytoreductive surgery and platinum-based chemotherapy, the 5-year survival rate
for patients with clinically advanced ovarian cancer is only 15–20%, although the cure rate
for stage I disease is usually greater than 90% [3,4]. This strongly suggests that finding and
removing tumors that remain confined to the ovary should confer a substantial improvement
in survival. A stochastic model developed for annual screening indicated that shifting
diagnosis from late (stage III) to early (stage I) stages could result in 3.4 years of life saved
per patient [5]. Therefore, biomarker-based screening methodologies aimed at detecting
ovarian cancer at its earliest stages have the potential to result in substantial improvements
in overall survival for this disease.

Screening for early disease: requirements & reality
NIH-PA Author Manuscript
NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Considering the low prevalence of ovarian cancer, any proposed screening strategy must
demonstrate a minimum specificity (SP) of 99.6% and a sensitivity (SN) of >75% to achieve
a positive predictive value of 10% and avoid an unacceptable level of false-positive results
[6,7]. Present methods for detecting ovarian cancer include physical examination,
assessment of symptoms, imaging by several modalities (transvaginal ultrasound [TVS],
Doppler ultrasound, CT, MRI and PET), and serum levels of the CA-125 biomarker of
ovarian cancer [8–10]. CA-125 is the most robust and well-known serum biomarker for
detection of ovarian cancer. The initial finding of CA-125 levels greater than 35 U/ml in
approximately 83% of patients with advanced epithelial ovarian cancer and in only 1–2% of
the normal population led to investigations into its use as a biomarker for ovarian cancer
[11,12]. Furthermore, elevated levels of CA-125 are most strongly associated with serous
tumors, which represent the most aggressive histological type of ovarian cancer [13].
Subsequent analyses of CA-125 have revealed a number of limitations for the test. Although
CA-125 is frequently elevated in advanced-stage ovarian cancer, the protein is elevated in
less than 50% of stage I disease and is often normal in mucinous, endometrioid and clearcell carcinomas [14–20]. Moreover, a number of benign and malignant conditions may
result in falsely elevated CA-125 values [21,22]. Additional factors may influence the
CA-125 level, such as race/ethnicity, age, hysterectomy, smoking history and obesity [23].
Despite these well-recognized limitations, CA-125 is the most widely studied serum
biomarker for ovarian cancer. The best currently available protocol for early detection of
ovarian cancer, a combination of screening for elevated CA-125 and TVS in the presence of
elevated CA-125 [24,25], does not meet the stringent criteria for cost–effectiveness
espoused by the US Preventive Services Task Force [26]. As a result, no professional group
currently recommends screening for ovarian cancer in the general population [27–29]. Thus,
there is a critical need to develop additional informative biomarkers capable of
complementing CA-125 in order to achieve the requisite diagnostic performance necessary
for clinical advancement.
Two large, randomized trials that were designed to determine whether ovarian-cancer
screening improves survival have completed the enrollment of patients. In the Prostate,
Lung, Colon, and Ovarian (PLCO) Cancer Screening Trial, 34,261 healthy women between
the ages of 55 and 74 years of age were randomly assigned to undergo either annual CA-125

testing plus TVS or to receive ‘usual care’ [30]. A positive finding was defined as a CA-125
level of more than 35 U/ml or TVS evidence of an abnormal ovarian volume, or an ovarian
cyst with papillary projections or solid components. Diagnostic follow-up of positive
screens was performed at the discretion of participants’ physicians. The positive predictive
value of a positive screening test was 1.0–1.3% during the 4 years of screening. The overall
ratio of surgeries to screen-detected cancers was 19.5:1. Importantly, 72% of screendetected cases were stage III or IV, indicating that screening has not resulted in stage shift
[30]. The PLCO project team recently released its report in which they conclude that the
CA-125/TVS screening approach does not reduce disease-specific mortality in comparison
with usual care, but does result in an increase in invasive medical procedures and associated
harms [31].

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

In the United Kingdom Collaborative Trial of Ovarian Cancer Screening (UKCTOCS),
202,638 postmenopausal women between the ages of 50 and 74 years, who were deemed to
be at average risk for ovarian cancer, were randomly assigned to undergo annual pelvic
examination (control group), annual TVS (ultrasonography or USS group) or annual
measurement of CA-125 (evaluated over time with the use of ROCA) plus TVS in cases in
which the CA-125 level was elevated (multimodality or MMS group) [32]. Women with
persistent abnormality on repeat screens underwent evaluation by a clinical oncologist and,
where appropriate, surgery. As compared with ultrasonography alone, multimodality
screening had a significantly greater SP (99.8 vs 98.2%) and a higher positive predictive
value (35.1 vs 2.8%); (p < 0.001); SN did not differ significantly between the two groups.
The proportion of primary invasive ovarian and fallopian tube cancers diagnosed with stage
I/II disease (48%) was encouraging compared with the 26% rate in the clinical series [33]
and 22% in the prevalence screen of the PLCO screening trial in the USA [34]. Both the
USS and MMS arms demonstrated a higher proportion of stage I–II cancers. The apparent
difference between PLCO and UKCTOCS in proportion of screen-detected early cases could
possibly be explained by the mode of diagnostic follow-up utilized in each trial wherein the
suspicious cases identified in the PLCO trial were cared for by their physicians and in the
UKCTOCS trial the majority were referred to a gynecologic oncologist.

Ovarian cancer screening biomarkers: the forest
Phases of cancer biomarker development

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Biomarker development efforts to date clearly indicate that no individual biomarker,
including CA-125, can provide sufficient SN at high SP for the early detection of ovarian
cancer. Therefore, in order to devise a robust multimarker algorithm, it is necessary to
identify additional informative biomarkers that complement CA-125. According to the
requirements of the Early Detection Research Network/NIH, biomarker development should
include five phases; preclinical exploratory Phase I, clinical development and validation in
Phase II, validation in a retrospective longitudinal study in Phase III, prospective screening
in Phase IV and randomized clinical trials in Phase V [35].
Methodological approaches to protein biomarkers development
Noninvasive biomarker testing is essential for practical general population monitoring.
Therefore, biomarkers that can be detected in bodily fluids such as blood, urine, saliva or
cervical mucus could be considered. The candidate marker must be both stable in these body
fluids and present in quantities that can quantitatively differentiate individuals with ovarian
cancer from individuals without disease. In the arena of Phase I protein biomarker
development, a number of conceptual and methodological approaches have been utilized for
biomarker discovery in bodily fluids. Early efforts, including those responsible for the
identification of CA-125, described the analysis of murine antibodies capable of reacting

with tumor cells from ovarian cancer patients [36–38]. Later, biomarker discovery was
achieved primarily by means of high-throughput screening methodologies, such as genomic,
transcriptional and proteomic profiling [39–50]. Proteomic profiling provides direct
information about proteins differentially expressed in cancer patients and control
individuals. Such profiling has been performed by mass spectrometry [40] and, lately,
through the use of antibody arrays, such as multiplex bead-based arrays or reverse antigen
arrays [51,52]. Both approaches have limitations. To date, MS-based methods have
demonstrated limited analytical SN and, consequently, most of the biomarkers discovered by
proteomics represent high abundance, predominantly acute-phase proteins [53]. Recently,
developed methods aimed at the depletion of abundant serum proteins may overcome this
limitation and lead to the enhanced discovery of lower-abundance biomarkers [54,55].
Immunoassays permit the analysis of proteins present in bodily fluids at much lower
concentrations – as low as fg/ml – but this approach is limited by the availability of suitable
immunoassays. However, the menu of candidate biomarker immunoassays continues to
expand as the popularity of multiplex bead-based platforms grows. For instance, three large
screening exercises aimed at the identification of ovarian cancer biomarkers using multiplex
bead-based immunoassays evaluated over 300 candidate biomarkers in serum obtained from
large groups of ovarian cancer patients and controls [51,52,56].

Individual biomarkers of ovarian cancer: the trees
NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Our review of the relevant literature identified over 160 proteins reported to be differentially
expressed in early ovarian cancer compared with healthy controls (Table 1). The ongoing
analysis of these proteins, and the biological and pathological pathways they regulate could
provide powerful tools for determining the mechanisms of ovarian cancer initiation and
progression that could eventually lead to individualized biological therapies. However, as
mentioned above, further validation steps are necessary to determine the value if these
proteins, and relatively few have been evaluated in studies that meet the criteria for Phases II
and/or III biomarker development [51,52,57–61].
Origin of ovarian cancer biomarkers: tumor–stroma interaction

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

The complex and multifaceted process of ovarian epithelial tumorigenesis necessitates the
development of an equally complex tumor microenvironment. Within this
microenvironment, tumor cells, stromal fibroblasts and infiltrating leukocytes produce a
multitude of autocrine and paracrine factors, including but not limited to cytokines,
chemokines, growth factors, hormones, inflammatory mediators and acute-phase reaction
molecules. It is this complex signaling network that mediates tumor/stroma interactions and
facilitates tumor proliferation, invasion, neoangiogenesis and metastasis. As illustrated in
Table 1, concentrations of numerous proteins involved in the above listed tumorigenic
biological functions listed above are altered in the circulation of ovarian cancer patients.
Mediators of inflammation, including cytokines and acute-phase reactants, were the most
numerous among the various biological groups identified in our review, followed by
adhesion molecules/proteases, growth/angiogenic factors and hormones.
Biomarkers of ovarian cancer reflect different biological pathways of ovarian
tumorigenesis
The Ingenuity® pathway analysis software was utilized in an in-depth functional analysis of
the ovarian cancer biomarkers presented in Table 1. This analysis identified acute-phase
response signaling as a top canonical pathway and inflammatory response as a top biological
function associated with most ovarian cancer biomarkers (97/157 biomarkers = 62%). In
addition, cellular movement, cell-to-cell signaling, proliferation and cell death were
identified as primary molecular and cellular functions associated with ovarian cancer

biomarkers (Table 2). With respect to network analysis, most ovarian cancer biomarkers fall
into three major networks responsible for key aspects of cancer development (Table 3).
Network 1 (70/157 = 45% of molecules) regulates invasion/metastasis, neoangiogenesis and
immune responses; network 2 (24% of molecules) is responsible for DNA functions; and
network 3 (14% of molecules) controls the cell cycle and inflammation. Of these multiple
biomarkers, demonstrating strong association with ovarian cancer, the biomarkers with the
highest informative value, singly or combined into multibiomarker panels, must be selected.
In this selection process (feature selection), a two-pronged approach must be utilized
considering both bioinformatics and the biological aspects of each biomarker or biomarker
combination.

Feature selection
Biological considerations
The selection of the most informative biomarkers represents the most crucial and
challenging aspect of biomarker development. Prior to applying a bioinformatics-based
feature selection, candidate biomarkers must be prioritized based on biological
considerations that should include the following characteristics:

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

•

A biomarker should demonstrate measurable alterations in noninvasive samples
obtained from patients with early-stage or preclinical disease;

•

Collectively, biomarkers should be informative for all histological and pathological
subtypes of a given cancer. In the setting of ovarian cancer, this includes the
histological types (e.g., serous, mucinous, endometrioid, clear cell and less
common subtypes), and the pathologically distinct type I and II tumors (described
in [62]);

•

Individual biomarkers should be sufficiently reliable. The justification for a
sufficiently high intraclass correlation index between temporal replicates depends
on two factors: the magnitude of the intraclass correlation; and the degree of
overlap, or difference in mean expression, for the distributions of that biomarker
(i.e., between cases and controls). Specifically, the 95% confidence interval for the
median difference between cases and controls should exclude 0 for a given
biomarker to be considered in further analysis.

Bioinformatics approaches

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Biomarkers prioritized based on biological considerations should be further filtered using
bioinformatic approaches that rely on optimized feature selection of high-dimensional data.
The rule of thumb for feature selection is that features must be discriminant and add
information to existing biomarkers in the panel for the best separation of the two groups. In
the context of ovarian (or any other) cancer, the additive information feature means that
selected biomarkers should increase SN at the same high SP over CA-125 used alone.
Feature selection algorithms can be divided into three categories: filters, wrappers or
embedded methods [63]. A filter method ranks features based on an evaluation measure, and
then selects a subset of features that are ranked highly (e.g., two sample t-test). Using this
method, biomarkers were selected from Phase II to Phase III in a PLCO collaborative
exercise [64]. A wrapper method searches for the best set of features by repeated selection
and assessment of a subset of features using a classification algorithm. An example of a
wrapper method is the approach utilized in our work based on a Metropolis algorithm with
Monte Carlo simulation [51]. Embedded methods include feature selection inside of the
classifier training process. For example, decision trees implicitly determine which features
are more discriminant and use them in the learning of tree structures. Finally, the resulting
combination should not only be sensitive and specific but also selective for a given

condition with respect to other nonrelated diseases that have the potential to confound
clinical diagnosis. Below, we will discuss some aspects of feature selection.

Approaches & controversies in biologically based feature selection
Tumor versus stroma as sources of biomarker origin

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

There are several conceptual beliefs regarding biomarker prioritization that were not
included in the list above. For example, there is an opinion that only those proteins that are
directly released by tumor cells should be considered as cancer biomarkers [65]. In
accordance with this notion, many of the biomarkers listed in Table 1 would not be
considered as they are known to originate from various extratumoral sources (e.g., liver for
acute-phase proteins and pituitary gland for pituitary hormones). However, growing
evidence suggests that many of these so-called extratumoral biomarkers are likely to be
secreted by the growing tumor. For example, ovarian tumors and primary fallopian cells in
vitro are capable of secreting, in addition to CA-125, HE4 and CA 15–3, multiple acutephase reactants, inflammatory mediators, and additional molecules [Nolen LBM, Lokshin
AE, Unpublished Data] [66–68]. For example, the gastrointestinal hormone, ghrelin, has
been shown to be expressed in the human ovary and also in inclusion cysts within the
ovarian surface epithelium, where it induces cell proliferation, indicating a potential
tumorigenic role [69]. Likewise, matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) could originate from
multiple sources within the tumor microenvironment, including tumor cells themselves, as
well as the stroma, where they are presumably produced in response to growth factor and
cytokine signaling [70,71]. Another example is the pituitary hormone, prolactin, which has
been shown to be produced by several nonpituitary sources, including ovarian tumor cells,
using an alternate promoter; and also functions as an ovarian tumor promoter in vitro [72]. It
is possible that proteins secreted from tumor and from extratumoral sources are
differentially modified. For example, previous reports have indicated alterations in
haptoglobin, α1-acid glycoprotein and α1-antichymotrypsin in ovarian cancer patients [73].
Ovarian tumor cells also secrete cytokines that can influence glycan processing in both the
tumor cells and surrounding tissue [74]. Recent data indicate that ovarian tumor cells secrete
factors that alter the glycosylation profile of liver proteins, and raise the possibility that
some of the altered glycoforms of haptoglobin, α1-acid glycoprotein and α1antichymotrypsin may be tumor derived [75].
Acute-phase reactants

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

All biological aspects of feature selection are empirical by default, meaning that every
conclusion should be experimentally supported. One example illustrating the necessity of
experimental confirmation is the recent debate on the value of acute-phase reactants as
ovarian cancer biomarkers for early detection. The acute-phase is controlled by the balance
of proinflammatory cytokines (IL-6, IL-8, IL-1b, TNF-α and IFN-γ), anti-inflammatory
molecules (IL-4, IL-10, IL-13 and TGF-β) and the inhibitors of proinflammatory cytokines
(soluble TNF-α receptor, soluble IL-1 receptor and IL-1). Proinflammatory cytokines
stimulate the increased production of positive acute-phase proteins (C-reactive protein
[CRP], serum amyloid A, haptoglobin, α1-acid glycoprotein, α1-antitrypsin, α1antichymotrypsin and fibrinogen) and decreased production of negative acute-phase proteins
(albumin and transferrin) by the liver [76,77]. As shown above, multiple ovarian cancer
biomarkers represent acute-phase reactants and acute-phase response signaling is a top
canonical pathway of ovarian cancer. Several statements have been published casting doubt
on the usability of acute-phase reactants for early detection of ovarian cancer based on the
belief that these biomarkers are altered as a part of an inflammatory response to late-stage
ovarian cancer [78–81]. However, acute-phase reactants, as well as many proteins
conventionally considered to represent late systemic responses could, in fact, play a

Nolen and Lokshin

causative role in cancer development. For example, inflammatory cytokines and acute-phase
response proteins could be a part of an initial ‘para-inflammation’ phenomenon provoked by
a premalignant lesion [82]. During a para-inflammatory response, leukocytes and other
phagocytic cells produce an array of cytokines and reactive nitrogen and oxygen species,
that upon repeated exposure, result in permanent DNA damage in endothelial and epithelial
cells [83–85]. Additionally, cytokines and acute-phase reactants play multiple roles in early
cancer development, from inducing tumor growth and inhibiting apoptosis to stimulating
angiogenesis (Table 1) [85–92]. For example, apart from being a serine protease inhibitor,
α1-antitrypsin stimulates the production of HGF, and was found to induce the proliferation
of fibroblasts and the synthesis of procollagen in culture [93,94]. Another acute-phase
reactant, ceruloplasmin, which serves as the major copper transport enzyme in blood, also
acts as a molecular switch for activating proangiogenic factors [95]. The potential
differential expression of acute-phase reactants/inflammatory molecules in early-stage or
premalignant lesions has to be ascertained experimentally. In fact, levels of the acute-phase
reactant, B2M, were altered in the sera of women participating in the PLCO trial who were
diagnosed with ovarian cancer 0–2 years after the blood draw [64,96].
Upregulated versus downregulated cancer biomarkers

NIH-PA Author Manuscript
NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Another paradigmatic concept of a diagnostic biomarker holds that a particular protein must
be increased in biological fluids from cancer patients. The findings presented in Tables 1–4
indicate the need for a revision of this concept as proteins that are present at lower
circulating levels in cases versus controls have been incorporated into useful biomarker
panels. Examples of this type of biomarker include EGF receptor (EGFR) and ApoA1, two
biomarkers selected based on their usefulness in diagnostic panels which are observed at
lower levels in ovarian cancer patients in comparison with controls and are likely to be
produced, at least in part, by extratumoral local or systemic sources [51,52,57,58,97,98].
Further review of the findings reported in several expansive biomarker studies which
utilized multiplex bead-based immunoassay platforms [Nolen LBM, Lokshin AE,
Unpublished Data] [51,99] identified a total of 111 biomarkers found to be significantly
altered between the case and control groups (Table 5). By consensus, 69 or 62% of the
significant biomarkers found in these studies were elevated in the ovarian cancer groups,
while 41 (or 38%) were decreased. With the exception of carbohydrate antigen tumor
markers (CA-125, CA 19–9, CA 15–3 and CA 72–4), which are all elevated in the cancer
groups, each other functional category presented in Table 1 is represented by both
overexpressed and underexpressed biomarkers. Some protein families contain both up- and
downregulated representatives, such as the IGF family of proteins, where IGFBP-1, -2, -4
are increased in ovarian cancer while IGF-1 and IGFBP-3, -6 are decreased (Table 5). The
differential pattern of serum alterations reported in our reviewed studies suggests a complex
mechanism for the various member of the IGF family in ovarian cancer. Similarly, among
MMPs, MMP-2 and -3 were observed to be downregulated in ovarian cancer while MMP-7
and -9 were elevated. The majority of the hormones examined in the three studies were
found to be downregulated in ovarian cancer. Interestingly, these underexpressed hormones
include FSH, whose serum levels normally increased in post-menopausal women [100,101].
It has been speculated that this decrease indicates increased binding of FSH to its receptors,
which is irreversible at body temperature and results in permanent removal from the
circulation [102]. Other protein biomarkers underexpressed in ovarian cancer include
ApoA1 and transthyretin (TTR), which have been evaluated extensively as components of
diagnostic panels for ovarian cancer and may originate from tumoral, local or systemic
sources [62,68,103,104]. The adhesion molecule, VCAM-1, was observed to be
downregulated in ovarian cancer in two studies and this alteration led to its inclusion in a
highly effective diagnostic panel in our recent report [51]. Among other biomarkers
downregulated in the circulation of patients with ovarian cancer are eotaxin-1 and -2, IL-18,

macrophage-derived chemokine, XCL1, EGFR, BDNF, ErbB2, IGFBP-3 and -6, IGF-I,
PEDF, SCF, VCAM-1, MMP-2 and -3, NCAM, adiponectin, ERα, ghrelin, GIP, insulin,
leptin, leuteinizing hormone, osteocalcin, thrombopoietin, α2-macroglobulin, ApoA1, CIII,
H, clusterin, complement C3 and C4, factor VII, fetuin A, TTR, Fas, perforin and CK-MB
(Table 4). While mechanisms leading to lower circulating concentrations of these proteins
are likely to vary, some may be attributed to increased clearance from the circulation
through renal filtration. This notion is supported by the observation of increased urinary
concentrations of eotaxin-1, EGFR, ErbB2 and VCAM-1 in patients with ovarian cancer as
compared with healthy individuals [Nolen LBM, Lokshin AE, Unpublished Data].
Elsewhere, irreversible binding to cognate receptors on proliferating tumor cells [105] or
internalization could result in lower blood levels. Additionally, differential glycosylation
patterns could affect half-life of some biomarkers in circulation [75,106,107].

Biomarkers of different subtypes of ovarian carcinoma
Histological subtypes

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Current evidence strongly suggests differential mechanisms of pathogenesis, genetic
alterations and clinical behavior among the major histological subtypes of ovarian cancer,
which include serous, endometrioid, mucinous and clear cell carcinomas (reviewed in
[108]). These subtypes are increasingly considered to be distinct diseases originating from
separate nonovarian tissues through mechanisms involving the presence or absence of
specific precursors, including endometriosis. The tumor marker CA-125 is most highly
associated with high-grade serous carcinomas, the most prevalent and aggressive ovarian
cancer subtype, with other subtypes exhibiting only limited expression [18–20].

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

A number of the most intensely evaluated ovarian cancer biomarkers, including several of
those selected in diagnostic panel development (Table 4) have shown some evidence of
subtype SP in various reports. Expression of carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) is associated
with the mucinous subtype [109], and CEA was consistently selected by our MMC
algorithm as part of a multimarker panel for a set of ovarian cancers representing different
histologies [Nolen LBM, Lokshin AE, Unpublished Data] [51]. The expression of MMP-2,
-7 and -9 have been well described in serous ovarian carcinomas with links to disease
progression [1,110,111]. Expression of MMP-7 and -14 has also been noted in mucinous
and clear cell carcinomas, respectively [112,113]. Expression of IGF-II by ovarian cancer
cells was found to be associated with serous histology and this expression was driven by
distinct promoters in comparison with nonserous histologies [114,115]. In separate studies,
VEGF was found to be frequently expressed in both serous and clear cell ovarian
carcinomas, and was proposed as a potential therapeutic target for these subtypes [2,116].
M-CSF is expressed by both serous and mucinous ovarian cancers, and is believed to
stimulate the phenotypic shift of tumor-associated macrophages to M2, thus promoting
tumor growth [117]. Based on our reviewed findings and another recent publications, it
would appear that high-grade serous carcinoma is associated with a larger array of
aberrantly expressed biomarkers than other subtypes [118]. When biomarker combinations
were considered, the panel of ApoAI, TTR and TF demonstrated particular utility in the
detection of mucinous and endometrioid ovarian carcinomas [68,104,119].
Classes of ovarian cancer: type I versus type II
Kurman and colleagues have described two classes of ovarian cancer. Type I tumors are
low-grade serous, low-grade endometrioid, clear cell, mucinous, and transitional carcinomas
that exhibit Ras and Raf mutations, slow indolent growth and generally present as early
stage. Type II tumors include high-grade serous, undifferentiated and malignant mixed
mesodermal cancers with p53 mutations, are highly aggressive, evolve rapidly and present at

an advanced stage [62]. Currently, the most urgent unmet need is to more effectively screen
for type II cancers, where the clinical benefit will be greatest. This will require sensitive and
specific biomarkers that are expressed during ovarian carcinogenesis and reach the
peripheral circulation at levels distinguishable from those in healthy individuals at a point
sufficiently early to permit interventions that can alter the natural history of the disease. If,
however, detecting type II ovarian cancer at an early stage proves difficult, the identification
of women with small volume disease offers a reasonable alternative, as these are patients
known to benefit most from chemotherapy. Detection of type II cancers from within highrisk populations has been particularly difficult and the use of multiple markers might
improve SN [120]. To date, only one study examined levels of multiple biomarkers (MIF,
Prolactin, CA-125, OPN, leptin, IGF-II and autoantibodies to p53) in plasma of type I and
type II ovarian cancer and concluded that these biomarkers had significantly different
plasma levels between type II ovarian cancer patients and healthy controls [121].

Selection of multimarker panels based on postdiagnostic samples

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

A number of studies evaluating multimarker panels in postdiagnostic samples utilizing
various criteria for biomarker prioritization and selection were reviewed (Table 4). In the
study by Mor et al., 169 proteins were analyzed in serum samples obtained from ovarian
cancer patients by means of rolling circle amplification (RCA) immunoassay microarray,
and 35 of these proteins were found to be differentially expressed between cases and
controls [56]. Biomarkers were further prioritized for independent ELISA testing if similar
levels of expression were observed in newly diagnosed patients and patients with recurrent
disease; ELISA tests were available commercially for these analytes; and they had
compelling biological reasons for their evaluation. These analytes were EGF, MIF-1, TNFα, leptin, prolactin, IL-17, OPN and IGF-II. Leptin, prolactin, OPN and IGF-II showed
perfect correlation between the RCA microarray immunoassays and the ELISA assays, and
were able, when used together, to discriminate the control and cancer training group samples
with 95% SN at 95% SP. Adding CA-125 and MIF to this panel provided a classification
power of 92% SN at 99% SP. This panel was equally sensitive to different histologic
subtypes of primary epithelial ovarian cancers – papillary serous, clear cell, endometroid
and mixed [60]. Unfortunately, following a high level of initial enthusiasm and the
subsequent marketing of this panel under the trade name OvaSure™ (Labcorp, NC, USA),
deficiencies in study design have been identified that illustrate the challenges facing
biomarker development efforts in general. Most prominent among these deficiencies was the
inaccurate calculation of positive predictive value based on improper estimates of ovarian
cancer prevalence [122,123]. This observation, coupled with the lack of evaluation in a large
prospective study, led to performance revisions and the withdrawal of the commercial kit.

In the recent study by Havrilevsky et al. [124], a literature review was conducted for
investigations describing transcriptional profiling of epithelial ovarian cancer. Candidate
biomarkers meeting the following inclusion criteria were selected: overexpression of
candidate gene in epithelial ovarian cancer relative to normal ovarian epithelium;
overexpression of encoded protein in ovarian tissue; localization of encoded proteins to
extracellular compartment as membrane-bound or secreted protein; and discrimination of
ovarian cancer from normal sera utilizing prototype immunological assays. Correlation with
CA-125 was not evaluated. Based on these criteria, eight genes – HE4, glycodelin (PAEP),
MMP-7, MUC-1, PAI-1, SLPI, Plau-R and inhibin A – were selected as candidate markers
for inclusion. Several combinations of these proteins were evaluated and a combination of
CA-125, HE4, glycodelin, Plau-R and MMP-7 was selected, which offered 79% SN at 93%
SP for early-stage ovarian cancer [124].

Our group utilized a subject cohort that included more than 2000 healthy women in an
unbiased analysis of serum biomarker candidates [51]. Feature selection was performed
based on both bioinformatics and the following biological considerations: high accuracy in
early-stage disease; equal classification of all ovarian cancer histologies; and selectivity for
ovarian cancer versus benign disease and other epithelial cancers [51]. Our identified panel
of CA-125, HE4, CEA and VCAM-1 was found to discriminate early-stage ovarian cancer
from the control group with 86% SN at 98% SP.

In a multicenter case–control study, Zhang et al. utilized SELDI-TOF to analyze sera
obtained from 195 patients with invasive epithelial or other types of ovarian cancer along
with patients diagnosed with benign pelvic masses and healthy control women [61]. The
investigators employed subsets of five separate centers for sequential components of their
analysis. Two centers were designated for biomarker discovery and candidate peaks from
the proteomic analysis were identified by cross-validation. These candidate biomarker peaks
were then validated in sera collected at two additional sites. Validated biomarker peaks were
then identified and the corresponding proteins purified. Candidate biomarkers for which
suitable immunoassays were available were then chosen for validation in sera collected at
the fifth site. Analysis of immunoassay results led to the identification of a four-biomarker
panel consisting of CA-125, ApoA1, TTR and H418. In the validation set, this panel
provided a SN of 74% at a SP of 97% for the discrimination of early-stage ovarian cancer
from healthy women.
In a separate study, Skates et al. evaluated serum levels of four biomarkers by immunoassay
in patients enrolled at three independent collection centers [59]. Sera collected at the first
center constituted the training set and biomarker data were analyzed using three statistical
models: logistic regression, classification tree and mixture discriminant analysis (MDA).
The MDA model is unique in that it emulates the heterogeneity of ovarian cancer with
respect to histological subtype and utilizes the distribution of biomarker levels within each
subtype to estimate the histological type of each sample analyzed. The authors conclude that
logistic regression and MDA modeling perform similarly and both outperform classification
tree in the discrimination of ovarian cancer cases from controls. The combination of
CA-125, CA 15–3, CA 72–4 and M-CSF, identified using the MDA model, performed best
in the independent validation set, providing a SN of 70% at 98% SP for early-stage ovarian
cancer.

Recently, Edgell et al. reported on a retrospective case–control study (Phase II biomarker
study) in which the authors utilized a multiplexed bead-based immunoassay platform to
evaluate five ovarian cancer biomarkers (CA-125, CRP, SAA, IL-6 and IL-8) in 362 plasma
samples obtained from ovarian cancer patients and healthy controls split into independent
training and validation sets [58]. Through multivariate modeling, the authors demonstrated a
SN and SP of 94.1 and 91.3%, respectively, for the five-biomarker panel in the validation set
and a SN and SP of 92.3 and 91.3%, respectively, for all early-stage ovarian cancers.
In another recent study, Amonkar et al. demonstrated the value of multiplexed analysis in
their evaluation of 104 candidate biomarkers in a cohort of over 350 ovarian cancer patients
and controls [57]. The cohort represented various stages of disease, and each of the most
common histological subtypes of epithelial ovarian cancer and most prevalent benign
ovarian conditions. Their training analysis led to the identification of an 11-analyte profile
consisting of CA-125, CA 19–9, EGFR, CRP, myoglobin, ApoA1, ApoCIII, MIP-1α, IL-6,
IL-18 and tenascin C. In an independent validation set, this panel provided a SN of 91.3% at
a SP of 88.5%.

Multimarker panels in prediagnostic samples
NIH-PA Author Manuscript

While many of the reports represented in Table 4 are initially encouraging, several hurdles
remain before any of the identified models can be implemented clinically on a widespread
basis. Foremost is the need to evaluate the most promising panels in prospective randomized
clinical trials. Additional preclinical validation will be required to fully characterize the
efficacy of selected panels before this significant next step is warranted. A key component
of this validation process is the evaluation of panels in samples obtained from prediagnostic
ovarian cancer patients. Progress towards this type of validation is greatly hindered by the
rarity of this sample type; however, several significant findings have been reported by a
group under the direction of Nicole Urban. In a pair of reports, this group first describes
elevated levels of CA-125, HE4 and mesothelin in the sera of symptomatic ovarian cancer
patients, and then in the sera of patients 0–3 years prior to diagnosis, noting an optimal lead
time of 1 year [125,126]. In a separate study, the investigators utilize a combinatorial
approach, including CA-125 and HE4 measurements, in addition to the Symptom Index to
prospectively classify benign from malignant pelvic masses with a SN of 84% at a SP of
98.5% (Table 4) [127]. These findings regarding the usefulness of CA-125 and HE4 in
prediagnostic and prospective samples are especially encouraging given the attention this
combination has received in recent reports.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Recently, a collaborative study was performed to assess the prediagnostic performance of
candidate biomarkers in the PLCO trial [64,128]. Forty one biomarkers selected by five
leading ovarian cancer biomarker laboratories from Harvard University, Fred Hutchinson
Medical Center, MD Anderson Cancer Center University of Pittsburgh and Yale University
were utilized in the analysis of 118 cases and 473 matched healthy controls [64,96]. The
selection of these markers proceeded from a Phase II validation study using a common
reference set of 160 ovarian cancer cases (~50% stage I/II) and 480 general population
controls based solely on individual performance (SN at 95% SP, AUC). The study
demonstrated that none of these biomarkers or multimarker panels added any appreciable
improvement in SN over that of CA-125 alone. Our subsequent analyses revealed that ten of
the selected biomarkers: HE4, mesothelin, CA 15–3, CA 72–4, KLK6, spondin-2, TTR,
Cyfra 21–1, IGFBP2 and YKL-40, were strongly (r > 0.35) correlated with CA-125 [Nolen
LBM, Lokshin AE, Unpublished_Data]. This lack of feature independence could be credited
as a limiting factor in the ability of these additional biomarkers to complement the
diagnostic performance of CA-125.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

In nearly all cases, efforts aimed at novel biomarker test development have relied upon the
use of biological fluid samples collected at the time of first diagnosis. It would appear from
the disappointing results of the PLCO study and others that this approach is not optimized
for the development of prediagnostic tests offering a potential window of early successful
intervention. Ongoing efforts of this type are unlikely to be productive, and the
incorporation of new strategies focused on the characterization and detection of preclinical
disease will be necessary for true advancement. Recent work suggests that a precursor lesion
for serous carcinomas, termed serous tubal intraepithelial carcinoma (STIC), does indeed
exist [129]. STICs originate from the fimbriated end of the fallopian tube, indicating a tubal,
rather than ovarian epithelial, origin for serous carcinomas. The identification of the
potential STIC precursor of serous carcinomas represents an important finding that may lead
to advances in detecting these tumors at an earlier stage. Perhaps analysis of blood samples
from patients who had undergone prophylactic oopherectomy where preneoplastic lesions
were discovered could prove useful, although substantial effort would be needed to collect a
statistically meaningful set of such samples. Finally, prospective identification of preclinical
biomarkers using mouse models of ovarian cancer could be helpful.

Conclusion
NIH-PA Author Manuscript

The search for biomarker-based screening tools for the early detection of ovarian cancer has
yielded a number of promising findings. Biomarker panels offering levels of SN and SP
exceeding 90% have been identified by a number of groups utilizing a variety of analysis
techniques and statistical models. Each of the panels identified demonstrates a clear
performance advantage over the individual performance of CA-125. Clinical
implementation of biomarker tools has been delayed, and sometimes reversed, in large part
owing to the stringent performance requirements associated with the detection of a rare
disease and the lack of a demonstrated survival benefit.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

The rapidly expanding appreciation of the heterogeneity of ovarian cancer presents
biomarker researchers with a unique set of questions and challenges. Among these
questions, the leading question is whether early detection efforts should target each of the
disease subtypes collectively or focus on the most troublesome high-grade serous tumors.
Clinical evidence describing the indolent nature of type I tumors (low-grade serous,
endometroid, mucinous, clear cell), which are readily detected by current practices suggest
the latter strategy might be most prudent. The difficulty in detecting the rapidly progressing
high-grade serous tumors at an early manageable stage also indicates a need to focus
biomarker development efforts on that individual subtype. However, within the setting of
differential diagnosis of a pelvic mass, an ideal test would be capable of identifying tumors
of multiple histological subtypes prior to referral for invasive diagnostic procedures. A
biomarker panel consisting solely of conventional tumor markers (i.e., proteins derived
directly from tumor cells and elevated in bodily fluids) is unlikely to accomplish this given
the divergent molecular characteristics displayed by the various ovarian cancer subtypes.
Likewise, although preferentially expressed by high-grade serous tumors, CA-125 alone is
not sufficient for diagnosis or screening. The development of truly useful and clinically
applicable biomarker-based diagnostics will require a broad and meticulous search through
the forest of ovarian cancer biomarkers. This search should be conducted with an eye for
biological relevance and bioinformatic performance, and should employ flexible criteria that
permit the consideration of a diverse set of candidates.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

The limited performance of serum biomarkers in the testing of prediagnostic samples
indicates the need to identify additional useful biomarkers that may display alterations
earlier in disease development. Further investigation into the tumorigenic pathways
associated with each subtype of epithelial ovarian cancer is likely to provide a basis for
additional biomarker discovery and development. The identification of the potential STIC
precursor of serous carcinomas represents an important finding that may lead to advances in
detecting these tumors at an earlier stage. Currently, findings related to the subtype-specific
production of ovarian cancer biomarkers are sporadic and incomplete. The ongoing
paradigm shift regarding the tissue of origin and pathogenesis of disease subtypes should
give rise to additional investigations of this type. A greater appreciation of the natural
history of each subtype of ovarian cancer, including the involvement or absence of precursor
lesions, should further refine the search for useful prediagnostic biomarkers.

Future perspective
Biomarker-based screening tools for ovarian cancer are likely to advance well into clinical
practice over the next 5–10 years. Implementation in the setting of routine screening will
depend largely upon continually emerging findings from prospective clinical trials along the
lines of PLCO and UKCTOCS. Physicians, researchers and public health officials will be
required to weigh the potential survival benefits against the economic and social tolls
associated with population-based screening. The continued improvement and refinement of

screening tools, including the identification of biomarker panels providing diagnostic
capabilities superior to that of CA-125, should steadily tip the balance in favor of
implementation. The incorporation of extratumoral biomarkers and the use of alternative
analytical biofluids, such as urine, will likely contribute to this advancement. A paradigm
shift in our definition of ovarian cancer biomarkers will likely be coupled to this
advancement in biomarker-based tools. The increased identification and utilization of
proteins derived from extratumoral biological compartments, proteins observed at decreased
levels in patients relative to healthy individuals and proteins that provide complementary
value through SP for a particular disease subtype is likely to characterize progress related to
biomarker research.

Executive summary

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Background
•

Ovarian cancer is the most lethal gynecological malignancy.

•

Ovarian cancer is characterized by nonspecific symptomatic presentation,
complicating early detection.

•

A shift in diagnosis from late- to early-stage disease could lead to a significant
increase in survival.

Screening for early disease: requirements & reality

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

•

Current methods utilized in the detection of ovarian cancer are inadequate for
use as population screening tools.

•

The CA-125 blood test is widely utilized but is characterized by several
limitations.

•

Two large prospective clinical trials investigating ovarian cancer screening
(PLCO and UKCTOCS) have reported mixed findings.

•

An expanded analysis of subtype-specific biomarker alterations, including
specific precursors of those subtypes, should lead to improved biomarker
discovery and development.

Ovarian cancer screening biomarkers: the forest
•

The Early Detection Research Network has outlined five phases required for
successful biomarker development.

•

A large number of candidate biomarkers for ovarian cancer have been identified
in several bodily fluids, primarily serum, through the use of multiple
technological platforms.

•

Multiplexed platforms permit the evaluation of large arrays of potential
biomarkers at minimal time and sample volume requirements.

Individual biomarkers of ovarian cancer: the trees

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

•

Our review identified 160 proteins altered in the sera of ovarian cancer patients
and healthy controls.

•

The list of candidate biomarkers can be broken down on the basis of biological
properties into the following functional groups presented in order of
predominance: mediators of inflammation; acute-phase reactants; adhesion
molecules and proteases; hormones; and growth and angiogenesis factors.

•

The multiple functional groups represented by the array of biomarkers may be
indicative of the multiple tumorigenic pathways involved in the development of
ovarian cancer.

Feature selection
•

In the selection of candidate biomarkers for inclusion in diagnostic multimarker
panels, proteins should be first prioritized based on the following biological
characteristics: measurable alterations in noninvasive samples; informative for
all histological and pathological subtypes; and temporal reliability.

•

Specific considerations for biomarker selection include biomarker specificity for
the various histological subtypes of ovarian cancer; biomarker specificity for

type I and type II ovarian cancers; nonclassical biomarkers; and proteins
observed to be decreased in ovarian cancer patients and those produced by
extratumoral sources.
•

Bioinformatic feature selection algorithms can be divided into three categories:
filters, wrappers and embedded.

Approaches & controversies in biologically based feature selection
•

Several trends in ovarian cancer biomarker development challenge the premise
that biomarkers must arise directly from tumor cells and exhibit elevated serum
levels in patients versus controls: stroma-derived biomarkers; acute-phase
reactants; and downregulated proteins.

Biomarkers of different subtypes of ovarian cancer
•

Specific biomarkers associated with the various histological subtypes of ovarian
epithelial cancer may provide complementation and improved performance
when assembled into diagnostic panels.

•

Biomarkers associated with pathologically defined type II ovarian carcinomas
are especially sought after, given the aggressive nature of these tumors.

Selection of multimarker panels based on postdiagnostic samples

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

•

A number of groups have reported promising results based on samples collected
at or after the time of diagnosis.

•

Methods employed included immunoassay microarray, transcriptional profiling,
multiplexed bead-based immunoassay, SELDI-TOF mass spectroscopy and a
variety of bioinformatic analysis techniques.

Multimarker panels in prediagnostic samples
•

Several biomarkers including CA-125, HE4 and mesothelin have been evaluated
in prediagnostic ovarian cancer sample with some indication of efficacy within 1
year of diagnosis.

•

A large multisite evaluation of prediagnostic biomarkers in conjunction with the
PLCO Screening Trial identified several candidate biomarkers with measurable
alterations between ovarian cancer patients and controls.

•

No biomarker combination was identified that could outperform CA-125 alone
for discrimination between the two groups.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Conclusions
•

Preclinical findings suggest that diagnostic panel performance is approaching
the level required for clinical advancement; however, large-scale prospective
evaluation of selected panels is currently lacking.

•

The expanding view of ovarian cancer heterogeneity will likely lead to further
refinement of the goals of early detection and the methods employed to achieve
those goals.
