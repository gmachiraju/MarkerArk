Abstract
Background: Accurate detection of characteristic proteins secreted by colon cancer tumor cells in biological fluids could
serve as a biomarker for the disease. The aim of the present study was to identify and validate new serum biomarkers and
demonstrate their potential usefulness for early diagnosis of colon cancer.
Methods: The study was organized in three sequential phases: 1) biomarker discovery, 2) technical and biological validation,
and 3) proof of concept to test the potential clinical use of selected biomarkers. A prioritized subset of the differentiallyexpressed genes between tissue types (50 colon mucosa from cancer-free individuals and 100 normal-tumor pairs from
colon cancer patients) was validated and further tested in a series of serum samples from 80 colon cancer cases, 23 patients
with adenoma and 77 cancer-free controls.
Results: In the discovery phase, 505 unique candidate biomarkers were identified, with highly significant results and high
capacity to discriminate between the different tissue types. After a subsequent prioritization, all tested genes (N = 23) were
successfully validated in tissue, and one of them, COL10A1, showed relevant differences in serum protein levels between
controls, patients with adenoma (p = 0.0083) and colon cancer cases (p = 3.2e-6).
Conclusion: We present a sequential process for the identification and further validation of biomarkers for early detection of
colon cancer that identifies COL10A1 protein levels in serum as a potential diagnostic candidate to detect both adenoma
lesions and tumor.
Impact: The use of a cheap serum test for colon cancer screening should improve its participation rates and contribute to
decrease the burden of this disease.

Biomarkers for Early Diagnosis of Colon Cancer

Nowadays there is debate about which test should be used for
CRC screening. Until further evidence is collected, current
European guidelines accept the fecal occult blood test followed
by confirmatory colonoscopy, which is therapeutic when resectable adenomas are identified [4]. Most population-based screening
programs are using guaiac based fecal occult blood test, which
biochemically detects small traces of blood derived from bleeding
lesions in feces, or fecal immunological test, which is based on
immunodetection of human hemoglobin in feces. These tests have
a sensitivity of 80% for CRC and 28% for adenoma .1 cm, and
specificities in the range of 91 to 94% [5]. Moreover, patient
compliance with stool-based assays tends to be low [6]. The use of
colonoscopy as a gold standard for CRC screening is controversial.
It has reported higher sensitivity (97%) and specificity (98%) for
early detection of CRC, but it also has several pitfalls associated to
it: increased economic cost; requirement of highly trained staff;
uncomfortable bowel preparation; invasiveness; risk of morbidity
and mortality attached to the procedure [7,8]. Moreover, in
countries where national colonoscopy screening is available,
compliance has often been low [9].
Serum-based markers would be highly attractive for CRC
screening since they are minimally invasive and could be
integrated in any routine health checkup without the need of
additional stool sampling, thereby increasing acceptance among
patients. Current molecular biology techniques allow an easier
generation of many hypotheses of candidate biomarkers for
diagnosis, prognosis or therapeutic response in CRC, but the need
for a proper validation has been often reported [10–12]. The
underlying hypothesis is that tumor cells of CRC, even in its preinvasive stages, suffer important genetic alterations that induce
release of characteristic proteins or nucleic acids potentially
detectable in biological fluids obtained by non-invasive methods
such as blood or feces [11]. Detection by molecular biology
techniques of these substances will serve as a biomarker of disease
to develop diagnostic tests with improved predictive power of
current screening tests. Therefore, the aim of the present study was
to identify and validate new serum biomarkers and demonstrate
their potential usefulness for early diagnosis of colon cancer.

study were obtained at the time of surgery from a series of cases
with an incident diagnosis of colon adenocarcinoma attending the
Bellvitge University Hospital (Barcelona, Spain) between January
1996 and December 2007. Included cases were selected to form a
homogenous series of patients with stage II, microsatellite-stable
sporadic colon cancer. All patients underwent radical surgery and
did not receive chemotherapy prior to surgery. Pathologists
confirmed all colon cancer diagnoses and selected fresh tissue
samples from tumor and adjacent mucosa taken from the proximal
resection margin. A hematoxylin-eosin staining was performed on
a slide cut of the tumor specimen to guide the pathologist in
selecting an area with at least 75% of tumor cells. The stage
grouping followed the authoritative UICC guide ‘‘TNM Atlas, 6th
Edition’’. The best approximation to this classification was derived
from the information collected at the time of diagnosis for each
case.
Tissue samples of colon mucosa from cancer-free controls were
obtained through colonoscopy between February and May 2010.
A series of consecutive patients who underwent colonoscopy
indicated by symptoms (usually anemia, bleeding, gastrointestinal
pain or altered rhythm) were invited to participate. Those with
negative results (i.e. without colonic lesions) were included in this
study. None of them reported family history of cancer.
Finally, serum samples from colon cancer cases and cancer-free
controls were selected from an epidemiologic case-control study on
gene-environment interactions that has been previously described
in detail [14]. All serum samples were collected prior to surgery for
cases and just before colonoscopy for controls.
To simplify naming different sample types, here we will use
tumor (T) when referring to tumor samples from colon cancer
patients, adjacent normal (A) when referring to pathology normal
colon mucosa samples from colon cancer patients, and cancer free
(F) when referring to colon mucosa samples from cancer-free
individuals.
The Clinical Research Ethics Committee of the Bellvitge
University Hospital approved the study protocol, and all
individuals provided written informed consent to participate and
for genetic analyses to be done on their samples.

Methods

RNA extraction
Total RNA was isolated from frozen tissue samples using
Exiqon miRCURY RNA Isolation Kit (Exiqon A/S, Denmark),
according to manufacturer’s protocol, and considering all recommended precautions to avoid RNA degradation by RNases.
Extracted RNA was quantified by NanoDrop ND-1000 Spectrophotometer (Nanodrop Technologies, Wilmington, DE) and
stored at -80uC. The quality of these RNA samples was further
checked using RNA 6000 Nano Kit (Agilent Technologies, Santa
Clara, CA) following manufacturer’s guidelines, and was confirmed by gel electrophoresis. RNA integrity numbers (RIN)
showed good quality ([Q1 = 7.5; Median = 8.25; Q3 = 8.9] for
tumors, [Q1 = 7; Median = 7.5; Q3 = 8] for adjacent normal and
[Q1 = 7.8; Median = 8.3; Q3 = 8.65] for healthy normal). RNA
purity was measured with the ratio of absorbance at 260 nm and
280 nm (mean = 1.96, SD = 0.04), with no differences among
tissue types.

The biomarker assessment in this study was organized in
sequential and consecutive phases for discovery, technical and
biological validation, and proof of concept to test the potential
clinical use of selected biomarkers. Firstly, gene expression
microarray data were analyzed to identify candidate biomarkers
in tissue samples from colon cancer cases and cancer-free controls
(Discovery Phase). Secondly, using an alternative technique based
on quantitative real-time PCR (RT-qPCR), a selection of
differentially expressed genes was validated in the same set of
tissue biopsies (Technical Validation Phase), as well as in biopsies
obtained from an independent set of patients (Biological Validation Phase). Finally, the potential clinical use of the most promising
validated candidates was tested in serum samples from colon
cancer cases, a small set of adenomas, and cancer-free controls
through the detection of the corresponding secreted protein using
enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) tests (Proof of
Concept Phase). Reported STARD guidelines [13] have been the
basis for defining our protocol.

Discovery series - expression arrays
The discovery series included 100 pairs of tumor and adjacent
normal colonic mucosa samples and 50 samples of colonic mucosa
from cancer-free individuals (total n = 250). Total RNA extracted
from these samples was hybridized onto Affymetrix Human
Genome U219 array plates (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA)
following manufacturer’s recommendations. Four samples (two

adjacent normal-tumor pairs) were excluded from the dataset after
quality control. Thus, a final dataset of 246 arrays was used for
subsequent analyses.
Raw data were normalized using the Robust Multiarray
Average algorithm [15] implemented in the affy package [16] of
the Bioconductor suite (http://www.bioconductor.org) [17]. All
statistical analysis were done with the R statistical computing
software (http://www.r-project.org) [18].
Before the differential expression analysis was performed, lowvariant and Y-chromosome transcripts were removed from
subsequent analyses. For the remaining probesets, regularizedStudent’s t-tests were used to detect significant overexpression
between adjacent normal (A) or tumor samples (T) and cancer-free
mucosa (F). Bonferroni correction was applied to account for
multiple hypothesis testing. In order to narrow down the initially
obtained lists, candidate probesets were further filtered based on
different criteria: low expression levels and low variability in
cancer-free mucosa; large average fold change between T/F or A/
F; and homogeneity of effects among multiple probes for the same
gene, when available. Probesets that passed the filtering criteria
were mapped to genes, the units of information used for
downstream analyses.
A prioritization procedure was performed to select the best
candidate genes for validation using publicly available data [19–
24]. Criteria accounted for were related to reproducibility and
specificity issues: observed reproducibility of the expression
differences; very low levels of expression in blood tissue; and
selection of genes with large expression in colon tissue when
compared to other tissues according to GeneCards database
(http://www.genecards.org) [25], though most genes were expressed in multiple tissues. The gene expression dataset is available
in the National Center for Biotechnology Information’s Gene
Expression Omnibus [26] with GEO series accession number
GSE44076 and in the project website (http://www.colonomics.
org).

cancer patients and 34 from cancer-free controls). These samples
were collected between January 1996 and June 2011 following the
same protocol and stored under the same conditions as the
discovery series. cDNA was synthesized from the extracted mRNA
with the transcription first strand cDNA synthesis kit (Roche
Applied Science, Penzberg, Germany) following standard procedures.
Two sets of primers were designed for each gene, and each set
was assayed in duplicate. Three control genes were included in the
assay: ACTB, TPT1, and UBC. ACTB was chosen based on the
extensive previous literature pointing it as a suitable housekeeping
gene for gene expression analyses in colon samples [27–29]. UBC
and TPT1 were selected based on the high stability of their
expression levels across all samples in our array data (Figures S1
and S2). Interestingly, they had also been previously postulated as
potentially suitable housekeeping genes for gene expression assays
in colon samples [29].
Multiplexed RT-qPCRs assays were done using BioMark
Dynamic Array 96696 Plates (Fluidigm Corporation, San
Francisco, CA). Resulting images were analyzed with Fluidigm
Biomark software using standard parameters. Raw qPCR data
were processed with the HTqPCR package v1.10.0 [30]. Before
the assessment of differential expression between different tissue
types, the expression matrix was filtered for quality purposes. UBC
was finally selected as the housekeeping control based on the
stability of its threshold cycle values (Figure S2). Mann-Whitney
tests were used to compare expression levels between cancer-free
and adjacent normal samples and between cancer-free and tumor
samples. Each set of primers was analyzed independently, and the
set of primers that displayed the highest significant results in the
analysis of differential expression was selected as a representative.

Identification of serum biomarkers – proof of concept for
screening validity
To test the potential value for early detection, the most
promising candidates from the biological validation were assayed
in serum samples in a series of 80 colon cancer cases, 23 patients
with adenoma and 77 cancer-free controls, all tested in duplicate
to increase the precision of the experiment. Ten-milliliter samples
of peripheral venous blood were collected from colon cancer cases,
patients with adenomas and controls. After centrifuge for 15

Technical and biological validation – RT-qPCR for

minutes at 1000 rpm within 30 minutes of collection, serum was
aliquoted and stored at 280uC. Commercial ELISA kits from Life
Sciences Inc and R&D Systems, depending on availability, were
used according to the manufacturer’s instructions to assess serum
protein concentrations. All assays employ quantitative sandwich
enzyme immunoassay technique. The concentration of target
proteins in each sample was calculated from a standard curve run
in duplicate in each plate. The scientists examining these serum
samples were unaware of the patient’s diagnosis. A linear model
adjusting for age, gender and potential batch effects was used to
assess the statistical significance of the differential protein levels
among groups. The association of markers with patient characteristics as age and gender, multiple epidemiological factors and
tumor characteristics is shown in Table S1. Since some serum
markers showed extreme values for a few subjects, a rank-based
test was also performed. The results did not change in a relevant
way and the p-values derived from the linear models are reported.
The number of samples used was calculated to attain a 10%
precision on sensitivity and specificity estimates for expected values
of 75%. This required at least 72 subjects per group. For the
discovery series, this number was unbalanced to oversample
tumors, which have larger variability and a wide range of
candidates had to be analyzed. The validation series in serum
was supplemented with a smaller subgroup of adenoma (n = 23) to
explore the usefulness of the markers to detect this premalignant
lesion.

additional technical and biological criteria were applied to further
narrow down the list of potential candidates. This second set of
filters were based on assessing the consistency between the
different probesets for each gene; confirmation of our results in
independent and publicly available gene expression datasets; and
null or low expression levels of these genes in blood samples from
cancer-free individuals. Moreover, prior knowledge and molecular
information for each gene was compiled from the literature and
online databases to ensure the selection of the most reliable
candidates (i.e. protein secretion, tissue specificity, protein
function, previous evidence as a biomarker, among others). A list
of the 23 best candidates was finally selected for validation in the
next step (Table 2, columns 1–2).

Technical and biological validation
To ensure the reliability of the results obtained from the gene
expression arrays, the selection of 23 biomarkers was validated
with an alternative technique (RT-qPCR) both in the same set of
samples (i.e. technical validation), and also in an independent
series with equivalent clinical and epidemiological characteristics
(i.e. biological validation).
Figure 2 displays two-way gene and sample clustering of the
RT-qPCR expression values both for the results of the technical
(Figure 2a) and the biological validation (Figure 2b). Horizontal
axes of the heatmaps (i.e. columns) show a clear separation of
tumor samples from adjacent normal and cancer-free groups. The
vertical axis of genes (i.e. rows) showed two clusters of genes, one
for those differentially expressed between A/F and another for the
differentially expressed between T/F. These results highly
replicate the pattern of expression observed in the arrays in the
discovery phase, reinforcing the potential role of these genes as
diagnostic biomarkers of colon cancer. A formal comparison of the
expression differences between sample types for the technical and
biological validation is shown in Table 2, columns 3–4. Although
only p-values are displayed in Table 2, the expression levels of all
the validated genes behaved consistently throughout the different
phases, as depicted in Figure S3.

Results
Biomarker discovery
In this well-selected homogeneous set of samples, differences in
mRNA expression measured with Affymetrix HG-U219 array
plates were so remarkable that an unsupervised technique
(principal components analysis) using the full set of probesets
separated almost perfectly the three tissue types (Figure 1a). The
first principal component clearly divides tumor samples of colon
cancer cases (T) and non-tumor samples. Remarkably, the second
principal component also split cancer-free (F) from adjacent
normal samples belonging to patients with cancer (A).
From 33,853 probe sets included in the array with high
variability, 5,503 were over-expressed in A when compared to F,
and 11,229 were over-expressed in T when compared to F (p,
0.05, Bonferroni corrected). We have focused specifically on overexpressed genes because these differences are more likely to be
detected in serum, and therefore more suitable to be used as
diagnostic biomarkers. Interestingly, a remarkable level of overlap
(3,101 probe sets, ,56%) was found between these two lists of
probe sets, suggesting that adjacent normal mucosa in patients
with cancer had already experienced important alterations in gene
expression, and rising the importance of using cancer-free mucosa
as reference tissue. Global results from differential expression
analysis are shown in Figures 1b and 1c.
To prioritize candidates for diagnostic biomarkers, a set of filters
were applied to the initial set of differentially expressed probe sets.
These filters were based primarily on statistical criteria (i.e. large
fold-change between A/F or T/F, low levels of expression and low
variability in F samples). These filters yielded a final number of
242 selected probe sets between A/F and 443 between T/F,
corresponding to a set of 194 and 352 genes, respectively (Table
S2).
This first selection provided a list of 505 unique candidate
biomarkers with highly significant expression differences between
tumor and cancer-free tissue. Due to the technical difficulties
derived from the validation of such a large amount of biomarkers,

Proof of concept – identification of serum biomarkers
As a pilot proof-of-concept to demonstrate their potential
usefulness as colon cancer early diagnostic biomarkers, a selection
of 9 genes were tested in serum using ELISA tests. The
prioritization of these candidates was based on an extensive
literature review and availability of commercial ELISA kit.
Results for each protein are shown in Figure 3. Remarkably,
collagen type X alpha1 (COL10A1) displayed very high concentrations in colon cancer cases and adenomas when compared to
controls (p = 3.2e-6 and p = 0.0083, respectively). Serum concentrations of COL10A1 in controls, adenomas and colon cancer
cases by stage are shown in Figure S4. Interestingly, statistically
significant differences were found when controls were compared to
each one of the different tumor stages, except Stage I, probably
due to the small sample size of this group. The area under the
receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was 0.75 for cancer
and 0.76 when adenoma and colon cancer were considered
together (Figure 4), showing potential good classification ability.
Matrix metalloproteinase-7 (MMP7) also showed a significant
association but was not further considered because it was due to an
underexpression in adenomas compared to controls, which
represented the opposite sense of differential expression that we
were trying to validate. No combination of COL10A1 with any of
the other proteins significantly increased the area under the ROC
curve (data not shown).

results and high capacity to discriminate between paired tumor
and adjacent normal samples. A strong feature of our study design
is the inclusion of a set of samples from cancer-free controls
(n = 50). This has allowed us to identify genes that do not show
expression differences between adjacent normal and tumor tissue
from colon cancer patients, as well as to confirm that
overexpressed genes in tumors do not display high expression
levels in cancer-free colon tissue, which could preclude their
potential use as biomarkers. We have previously described that
gene expression of adjacent normal colon mucosa in a patient with
cancer already has been significantly altered when compared to
cancer-free colon mucosa [34], which reinforces the need of
including tissue from cancer-free individuals in projects aiming to
find diagnosis biomarkers for colon cancer.
The large number of candidates identified in the analysis of
expression data led us to prioritize which ones were to be selected
for further validation. We used a combination of criteria, which
included consistency with other publicly available datasets and
literature; low or no expression levels in cancer-free mucosa or
other tissues; expression predominant to colon cancer tissue; and
selection of secretable proteins. Since the identification of serum
proteins is expensive and time consuming, we undertook a
technical and biological validation of the best candidates before
attempting ELISA tests. The technical validation (i.e. in the same

Discussion
CRC screening with fecal occult blood test has demonstrated
efficacy in randomized trials. Nonetheless, the low specificity of the
test suggests the need of more accurate alternative diagnostic tests.
Sigmoidoscopy, colonoscopy and Computerized Tomography
scan (i.e. virtual colonoscopy) are strong alternative candidates,
but all have important limitations, mainly regarding costs, possible
severe side effects and reduced participation. Participation is an
important factor for screening effectiveness, and it is also a
generalized observation that screening based on fecal occult blood
test has low participation rates [31–33]. Thus, a diagnostic test
based on a routine blood test would probably be able to reach a
higher percentage of the population, and public health authorities
would favor such a test if efficacy and costs were similar to fecal
occult blood test. With these premises in mind, we started this
study to search for diagnostic biomarkers that can be detected in
blood with a simple and affordable ELISA test.
Our study of gene expression in colon tissue has confirmed
previous observations that a large number of genes are deregulated
in tumor when compared to adjacent normal mucosa. From about
20,000 genes interrogated in the expression array, and after
filtering by several restrictive criteria, 505 unique candidate
biomarkers have been identified (Table S2), with highly significant

set of samples but with a different technique) showed a remarkable
reproducibility of the expression level differences measured by
RT-qPCR and microarrays for all tested genes, thus confirming
that the expression dataset obtained with Affymetrix HG-U219
microarrays was of outstanding quality and reliably identified
expression differences between the different tissue types. Therefore, we expect that the number of false positives in the remaining
list (not validated) of significant differentially expressed genes
between tissue types to be low. Moreover, the confirmation of the
previously identified differences in a biologically independent
dataset also highlights the validity of the results obtained with
microarrays.

The next step in our sequential validation process was
attempting to identify in serum the corresponding proteins for
our candidate genes and assess their potential use for early
diagnosis. We also included a subgroup of patients with adenoma,
since this is also an important target for CRC screening. Using
commercial ELISA kits we could assess the protein levels of all the
genes prioritized. Remarkably, COL10A1 showed relevant
enough differences between controls and colon cancer patients
(p = 3.261026) to be proposed as a potential diagnostic candidate.
MMP7 also showed some differences for adenomas (p = 0.0092),
but showed an opposite direction to the expected one.

inflammatory drugs consumption, as indicative of inflammatory
conditions, but we could not find a strong association (Table S1).
Since the sample size used for the serum assays in our study is
limited, further validation studies are needed to confirm that
COL10A1 is useful for population screening. However, the large
differences observed among colon cancer patients and cancer-free
controls position this biomarker as a promising candidate. We
have adjusted the analyses for age, gender and batch effect to
control for potential confounding. This was only relevant for
MMP3, which showed a strong association with gender.
COL10A1 also shows an association with primary tumor (T)
reinforcing the idea that the association could be an additional link
with colon cancer and tumor size (Figure S5) more than stage,
showing no association. Other potential confounders explored,
including multiple epidemiological factors and tumor characteristics, were not associated with serum levels of the different
markers (Table S1).
Our findings evidence that serum biomarkers for CRC
screening can be identified and may change the scenario in a
near future. Other blood molecular markers can also be of interest.
Detection of DNA methylated septin 9 (SEPT9) gene is a
promising candidate in the development of a non-invasive
molecular screening method [43,44]. Although the SEPT9 assay
successfully identified 68% of colon cancers at a specificity of 89%
[45], the cost of the test is high since it involves DNA extraction
and a quantitative DNA methylation assay. Besides, the method of
assaying DNA methylation is still a handicap for the creation of a
robust diagnostic tool, since a quantitative PCR step is often
required. Another biomarker for colon cancer is the fecal detection
of aberrant methylation of Vimentin gene (VIM). In this case the
authors report a sensitivity of 46% for a specificity of 90% [46].
However, biomarkers based on serum proteins detected by
conventional ELISA could be cheaper and more reliable to be
used in a daily clinical practice and for population screening. The
detection of the carcinoembryonic antigen [47] is one of the most
widely used tumor markers worldwide, especially in CRC.
Although in clinical use for almost 30 years, with clear value for

We have identified the protein COL10A1 which, when detected
at high concentrations in blood, may be indicative of the presence
of a neoplastic lesion in the colon. This protein was selected after a
sequential procedure in which we started exploring whole genome
expression data in colon tissue. Elevated serum levels of COL10A1
were observed both for adenoma and colon cancer patients. The
area under the ROC curve was 0.76, which makes COL10A1 as a
promising diagnostic biomarker. The cutpoint of 280 ng/ml
attained 0.63 sensitivity and 0.85 specificity for colon cancer or
adenoma (Figure 4). Similar values were obtained for cancer only.
A few cancer-free subjects showed high levels of COL10A1 in
serum, higher than the average for adenoma, indicating that other
processes not related to colorectal lesions can increase COL10A1
levels.
COL10A1 is a short chain collagen mainly expressed by
chondrocytes during ossification. Defects in this protein have been
related to Schmid-type metaphyseal chondrodysplasia [35].
COL10A1 is not expressed in normal colon epithelium, but is a
direct transcriptional target of RUNX2 [36], a transcription factor
that is expressed in cancer cells, and has been related to multiple
cancers. The elevated expression of COL10A1 observed in tumors
might be an indirect effect of higher-level regulatory alterations
occurring in the tumor. In fact, we have observed a high
correlation between RUNX2 and COL10A1 expression in tumors
(Pearson R = 0.5, results not shown). Our expression data also
identifies high correlation between COL10A1 and other genes:
SFRP4, INHBA, TNFSF4 that are involved in cytokine and Wnt
signaling [37–40]. Recently COL10A1 has been found to be
overexpressed in diverse tumors related to the vasculature
component [41]. However, the expression in other tissues other
that cartilage is low, which contributes to the specificity observed
in our study. Moreover, a recent study suggests that COL10A1
expression may be regulated by non-steroidal anti-inflammatory
drugs [42], which have protective effect on CRC risk, suggesting
that the mechanism of COL10A1 overexpression might be also
related to inflammatory processes. Specifically, we have also
explored if COL10A1 levels were related to non-steroidal anti-

prognosis and progression detection of CRC, the value of
carcinoembryonic antigen in colorectal cancer screening is low
mainly due to its low sensitivity (about 35%) and specificity
(between 30 and 80%) [48]. Other candidate biomarkers have
been proposed by other studies, such as metalloproteinases MMP7
[49] and MMP9 [50]. MMP7 was one of the potential biomarker
that appears in our candidate list. In that study the authors
reported a 58% of sensitivity and 100% of specificity, and the area
under ROC curve was 0.81, but we have not been able to confirm
these results with the commercial ELISA kit used. As the authors
pointed, further studies are required involving larger numbers of
subjects, to confirm these results.
Although many other biomarkers for colon cancer have been
previously proposed [51–54], in most cases there is no further
progress beyond the proposal [2,6,11,55–57] since none of them
may have sufficient sensitivity and specificity to be considered in
the current guidelines [13].
It is possible that other genes from the list of candidates
identified in the expression analysis also could be useful for early
diagnosis, either alone or in combination with COL10A1.
Therefore, further studies are required to assess the utility of
other potential biomarkers for the early detection of colorectal
cancer.
In conclusion, after different steps of sequential validation, we
have identified a list of candidate biomarkers for early detection of
colon cancer. The most promising one is the detection of
COL10A1 in serum, which can identify adenoma and invasive
cancer with high sensitivity and specificity. The use of a cheap
serum test for CRC screening should improve participation and
contribute to decrease the burden of this disease.
