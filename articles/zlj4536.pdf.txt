Purpose
Preliminary studies have identied prosurfactant protein B (pro-SFTPB) to be a promising blood
biomarker for nonsmall-cell lung cancer. We conducted a study to determine the independent
predictive potential of pro-SFTPB in identifying individuals who are subsequently diagnosed with
lung cancer.
Patients and Methods
Pro-SFTPB levels were measured in 2,485 individuals, who enrolled onto the Pan-Canadian Early
Detection of Lung Cancer Study by using plasma sample collected at the baseline visit.
Multivariable logistic regression models were used to evaluate the predictive ability of pro-SFTPB
in addition to known lung cancer risk factors. Calibration and discrimination were evaluated, the
latter by an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). External validation was
performed with samples collected in the Carotene and Retinol Efcacy Trial (CARET) participants
using a case-control study design.
Results
Adjusted for age, sex, body mass index, personal history of cancer, family history of lung cancer,
forced expiratory volume in one second percent predicted, average number of cigarettes smoked
per day, and smoking duration, pro-SFTPB (log transformed) had an odds ratio of 2.220 (95% CI,
1.727 to 2.853; P  .001). The AUCs of the full model with and without pro-SFTPB were 0.741
(95% CI, 0.696 to 0.783) and 0.669 (95% CI, 0.620 to 0.717; difference in AUC P  .001). In the
CARET Study, the use of pro-SFPTB yielded an AUC of 0.683 (95% CI, 0.604 to 0.761).
Conclusion
Pro-SFTPB in plasma is an independent predictor of lung cancer and may be a valuable addition to
existing lung cancer risk prediction models.

INTRODUCTION

Despite reduced smoking rates in the western world,
lung cancer remains the leading cause of cancer
mortality in the United States and elsewhere. In
2013, it is projected that more than 160,000 Ameri-
cans will die from lung cancer, which represents
29% of all cancer deaths in men and 26% of all
cancer deaths in women.1 Lung cancer survival is
largely dependent on stage at diagnosis. Whereas
localized disease (without lymphatic or distant
spread) is associated with a 5-year survival greater
than 50%, those with distant or regional metastasis
have survival measured in weeks to months.1 Unfor-
tunately, less than 15% of all tumors are found as
localized disease. The advent and widespread avail-
ability of thoracic computed tomography (CT)
scanning has the potential to shift detection to ear-
lier stages and thus improve survival. Data from the

National Lung Screening Trial (NLST) suggest that
yearly screening with low-dose thoracic CT scans in
high-risk current smokers and ex-smokers reduces
lung cancer mortality by 20% and total mortality by
7%.2 However, if these data are generalized and ap-
plied to the entire US population, CT screening
strategy would cost $1.3 to $2 billion per year.3

A potential low-cost solution to this dilemma is
to develop a simple blood test that can augment
clinical information in risk-stratifying smokers for
early detection of lung cancer. Several promising
candidate biomarkers have been published previ-
ously. Here, we report on the possible role of circu-
lating prosurfactant protein B (pro-SFTPB) as a
biomarker for early detection of nonsmall-cell lung
cancer (NSCLC). SFTPB is synthesized initially as a
hydrophilic 42-kD protein by type 2 alveolar pneu-
mocytes and nonciliated bronchiolar cells as pro-
SFTPB. On synthesis, pro-SFTPB quickly undergoes

proteolytic cleavage by cysteine proteases in the endoplastic reticulum
resulting in the synthesis and secretion of a 9-kD noncollagenous
hydrophobic SFTPB, which is the functional mature form of SFTPB.4
Lung tumor cells (especially adenocarcinomas) have dysregulated
SFTPB synthesis leading to the overexpression of pro-SFTPB with
muted ability to post-translationally modify the precursor into the
mature hydrophobic form.5,6 We have recently demonstrated that
levels of circulating mature SFTPB were increased in patients with
resectable NSCLC relative to matched controls.7 Mass spectrometric
identication indicated N-terminal pro-peptide of SFTPB as a poten-
tial biomarker for NSCLC. A sandwich pro-SFTPB enzyme-linked
immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was then developed and validated in
plasma samples obtained at the time of diagnosis from patients with
operable NSCLC and from healthy controls. The study aims were thus
to determine whether plasma levels of pro-SFTPB are associated with
lung cancer independently of known clinical risk factors and improve
lung cancer prediction beyond currently existing prediction models in
individuals at high risk for lung cancer.

PATIENTS AND METHODS

Study Populations

Pan-Can Study. The initial discovery work was performed on data from
the multicenter Pan-Canadian Early Detection of Lung Cancer (Pan-Can)
Study (NCT00751660; Screening Methods in Finding Lung Cancer Early in
Current or Former Smokers), which enrolled 2,537 individuals with no prior
history of lung cancer but with a minimum 2% 3-year risk of lung cancer as
predicted by lung cancer risk prediction models.8,9 Following informed con-
sent, all participants completed a structured epidemiologic questionnaire and
had blood samples drawn, processed, and stored in a study biorepository at
baseline. The participants also underwent low-dose noncontrast-enhanced
thoracic CT scanning and spirometry, according to American Thoracic Soci-
ety/European Respiratory Society guidelines.10 All study participants were
followed up in person at least every 6 months for at least 2 years or until the date
of lung cancer diagnosis, date of death, loss to follow-up, or February 1, 2013,
whichever came rst. The primary outcome was the occurrence of lung cancer
during follow-up. Details of the Pan-Can Study have been presented elsewhere
and are summarized in the Data Supplement.11 The study was approved by the
Clinical Research Ethics Board of the University of British Columbia and at
each of the participating Pan-Can Study sites.

CARET Study. The validation test samples consisted of sera collected
from participants in the Carotene and Retinol Efcacy Trial (CARET). CARET
was a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study to
evaluate the efcacy and safety of daily supplementation with 30 mg of beta-
carotene and 25,000 IU retinyl palmitate on primary lung cancer prevention.12
Eligible participants were men and women age 50 to 69 years who were either
current or former smokers (quit within the previous 6 years) and had at least 20
pack-years of cigarette smoking (n  14,254) or were men age 45 to 69 years
who were current or former smokers (quit no more than 15 years prior to the
start of the study) and had a substantial history of occupational asbestos
exposure (n  4,060). Participants were enrolled from 1985 to 1994 and were
observed for cancer and mortality outcomes until 2005. For this study, we
randomly selected 61 current smokers who developed NSCLC during
follow-up and analyzed pro-SFTPB in serum samples, which had been col-
lected within 12 months before the diagnosis of NSCLC. For each case, two
controls who were free of lung cancer throughout CARET follow-up were
selected and were matched for age, sex, smoking history (current smoker),
study enrollment cohort, and the date of blood draw. One-to-two case-control
matching was possible for all cases except for one patient, leading to 121
control participants. The clinical characteristics of the CARET participants are
provided in the Data Supplement. All serum samples were obtained following
informed consent and approval by the institutional review board of the Fred
Hutchinson Cancer Research Center.

Pro-SFTPB Assay

By using mass spectrometry, we discovered N-terminal and C-terminal
pro-peptides of SFTPB in the circulatory systems of mice that harbored lung
adenocarcinoma and in the conditioned media of NSCLC cell lines (Data
Supplement). Mouse monoclonal antibodies against the N-terminus of pro-
SFTPB (Data Supplement) were raised, leading to the development of a sand-
wich pro-SFTPB ELISA, which specically reacted with pro-SFTPB and did
not react with other surfactant proteins or mature SFTPB. The standards were
calibrated according to the absolute mass of the recombinant antigen (details
are provided in the Data Supplement). We then validated this assay with
plasma samples obtained at the time of diagnosis from patients with operable
NSCLC (n  28) and healthy controls (n  38). These samples had previously
been analyzed for levels of mature SFTPB by ELISA (see the Data Supplement
for demographics of the newly diagnosed NSCLC set). Plasma levels of pro-
SFTPB were signicantly higher in cases compared with controls (P  .001 by
the Mann-Whitney U test; Data Supplement). The area under the receiver
operating characteristic curve (AUC) of pro-SFTPB was superior to that of
mature SFTPB7(0.793 and 0.646, respectively; Data Supplement).

For the Pan-Can Study, the baseline plasma samples (ie, samples taken at
the time of enrollment) were used for the assay. For both the Pan-Can and
CARET studies, samples were blinded and analyzed by using pro-SFTPB
ELISA (details of the assay are provided in the Data Supplement). For samples
whose pro-SFTPB levels were below the level of detection, we assigned a value
that was half the detection limit. The median coefcient of variation was 6.1%.
Because the Pan-Can Study and the CARET Study used different standards,
the absolute levels of pro-SFTPB are not directly comparable.
Statistical Methods

Descriptive comparisons of study variables between groups used Fishers
exact test for categorical data, t test for continuous data, and nonparametric
test of trend for ordinal data. Multivariable logistic regression models were
used to evaluate whether pro-SFTPB was independently associated with lung
cancer. Known risk factors for lung cancer were evaluated in models and
included age, sex, body mass index (BMI), personal history of cancer, family
history of lung cancer, forced expiratory volume in one second percent pre-
dicted (FEV1 % pred), average number of cigarettes smoked per day, and
duration smoked. Pro-SFTPB was right skewed, and log-transformed pro-
SFTPB (log-proSFTPB) was used in modeling. Selected interaction terms,

including main effects and cross-product terms in the model and nonlinear
associations between continuous variables and lung cancer, were evaluated by
multivariable fractional polynomials.13 No interactions or nonlinear relation-
ships were found to be signicant.

Regarding prediction, improvement in discrimination was assessed
by comparing AUC between nested models with and without log-
proSFTPB. For AUCs, 95% CIs were prepared by using bootstrap resam-
pling with 1,000 samples.14 Calibration was assessed by evaluating the
mean and 90th percentile absolute errors.15 For each model, we calculated
a Brier score.16 Optimism or overt in models was assessed by using a
bootstrap method that employed Harrells RMS package in R (version
3.0.1).15,17 Bootstrap-optimism corrected estimates of AUCs and Brier
statistics are also presented. For comparative purposes, we produced Cox
proportional hazards survival models analogous to our logistic regression
models. All analyses, statistics, and gures were prepared by using
STATA/MP version 12.1 (STATA, College Station, TX). All presented P
values are two-sided.

In the CARET Study, pro-SFTPB levels were categorized into quintiles
on the basis of the distribution in control participants. Logistic regression was
performed to obtain odds ratios (ORs), and adjusted ORs were generated by
using multiple logistic regression analyses in which we controlled for matching
variables (age, sex, smoking status, enrollment period, and blood draw visit),
pack-years, years since quitting smoking, asbestos exposure, and BMI.

RESULTS

Study Populations

For the Pan-Can Study, enrollment began September 24, 2008,
and was completed on December 17, 2010 (Fig 1). As of February 1,
2013, 113 of 2,537 individuals had been diagnosed with lung cancer.
Pro-SFTPB data were available for 2,485 individuals. The minimum,
median, and maximum follow-up durations were 0.02, 3.02, and 4.36
years. During this follow-up period, 187 individuals (7.4%) were lost
to follow-up. Loss-to-follow-up status was not associated with pro-
SFTPB (P  .527), nor were pro-SFTPB levels associated with time to
loss-to-follow-up (P  .954). The overall cumulative incidence of

lung cancer was 4.45%, and the annual incidence rate of lung cancer
was 1.48 per 100 person-years of follow-up. Distributions of study
variables by lung cancer status are presented in Table 1.

Pro-SFTPB was measured in nanograms per milliliter; for pro-
SFTPB, the mean was 45.32 ng/mL (standard deviation, 44.64 ng/
mL), and the median was 31.93 ng/mL (interquartile range, 16.92 to
56.26 ng/mL). Distributions of pro-SFTPB by study variables are
presented in Table 2.

Prediction Models

In an unadjusted logistic model of log-proSFTPB predicting lung
cancer, the OR was 2.331 (95% CI, 1.837 to 2.958; P  .001) and the
AUC was 0.690 (95% CI, 0.642 to 0.735). The sensitivity and specic-
ity for log-proSFTPB over the range of model probabilities are pre-
sented in the Data Supplement. When the aforementioned model
probability for positivity is set to P  .032, sensitivity is 80.4%, speci-
city is 40.1%, the positive predictive value is 6.4%, and the negative
predictive value is 97.6%. In the unadjusted logistic model of log-
proSFTPB for events occurring at least 1 year after baseline blood
draw, AUC was 0.655 (95% CI, 0.570 to 0.719).

In the logistic model fully adjusted for lung cancer risk factors,
including smoking and nonsmoking predictors, log-proSFTPB was a
signicant independent predictor of lung cancer (OR, 2.220; 95% CI,
1.727 to 2.853; P  .001; Table 3). In the fully adjusted model, when
the analysis was limited to lung cancers occurring within the rst year,
the OR for pro-SFTPB was 2.53 (95% CI, 1.79 to 3.59; P  .001). The
AUCs for the full logistic models with and without log-proSFTPB
were 0.741 (95% CI, 0.696 to 0.783) and 0.669 (95% CI, 0.620 to 0.717;
difference in AUC P  .001; Fig 2). The respective bootstrap-bias
corrected AUCs were 0.718 and 0.636. When pro-SFTPB concentra-
tions were grouped into quintiles, the univariate OR per one level
change was 1.62 (95% CI, 1.39 to 1.89; P  .001) with a model AUC of
0.579 (95% CI, 0.526 to .626). In the multivariable model, the OR was

CI, 0.680 to 0.775). The improvement in magnitude in discrimination
attributable to pro-SFTPB is large compared with that of most lung
cancer predictors.18 Of the 113 lung cancers, 96 (85.0%) were stage I or
II. When the full model was estimated in these individuals, log-
proSFTPB remained a statistically signicant predictor (OR, 2.195;
95% CI, 1.679 to 2.870; P  .001) and signicantly improved the AUC
compared with the nested model excluding log-proSFTPB (0.735 v
0.659; P  .001).

The mean and 90th percentile absolute error (observed minus
predicted probabilities) in the model without log-proSFTPB were

0.005 and 0.007; for the model with log-proSFTPB, they were 0.004
and 0.010. For both models, the mean absolute errors in all deciles of
model-predicted risk were less than 1% (Data Supplement). For the
full model with log-proSFTPB versus the nested model without log-
proSFTPB, the Brier scores were 0.0438 and 0.0448, and the boot-
strap-biascorrected scores were 0.0442 and 0.0450, respectively.
These statistics indicate that calibration was excellent in both models
but slightly better in the model with log-proSFTPB.

The magnitude of Cox model hazard ratios and CIs was similar to
that of the ORs in the logistic models (Data Supplement). When the
full Cox model was limited to lung cancers that were diagnosed more

DISCUSSION

Our study demonstrates that plasma pro-SFTPB is signicantly and
independently associated with lung cancer and adds to lung cancer
prediction beyond that contributed by established risk factors in two
independent cohorts. Furthermore, pro-SFTPB was associated with
early-stage (I and II) lung cancer and with lung cancers diagnosed
more than 1 year after plasma collection, suggesting its potential utility
in predicting early-stage NSCLC tumors that may be amenable to
surgical resection.

The precise mechanism by which circulating pro-SFTPB lev-
els become increased in individuals at risk for NSCLC is unknown.
Surfactant proteins are transcriptionally regulated by thyroid tran-
scription factor 1 (TTF-1)/NK2 homeobox 1 (NKX2-1), which
plays a crucial role in lung development.19 TTF-1/NKX2-1 is mark-
edly increased in regions of lung parenchyma undergoing regener-
ation and repair.20 In addition, increased expression of TTF-1/
NKX2-1 in alveolar type II cells has been found to induce dose-
dependent alterations in alveolar morphology, epithelial cell
hyperplasia, emphysema, and pulmonary inammation.21 It is also
possible that circulating pro-SFTPB is a biomarker of lung condi-
tions that predispose to lung cancer such as chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease. In the Pan-Can Study, in which lung function
data were carefully measured, the inclusion of FEV1 did not mate-
rially alter the overall ndings, suggesting an alternate explanation.
Additional studies will be needed to understand the mechanisms
and pathways leading to increased plasma expression of pro-
SFTPB in those who develop NSCLC.

Our sample size and number of outcome events were ade-
quate to nd statistically signicant results regarding the relation-
ship between plasma levels of pro-SFTPB and lung cancer risk,
provide effect estimates with precise CIs, and demonstrate signi-
cant incremental improvement in prediction. However, because
more than 75% of the lung cancer cases diagnosed in the Pan-Can
Study were adenocarcinomas, we could not adequately evaluate
whether the relationship between pro-SFTPB and lung cancer risk
differed across different histologic tumor subtypes. In the CARET
Study, which proportionately had more cases of squamous cell

carcinoma, pro-SFTPB appeared to be less predictive in squamous
cell carcinomas than in adenocarcinomas (Data Supplement).
These data, however, should be interpreted with caution because of
small numbers of study participants. Moreover, our study took
place in individuals at high risk for lung cancer. It is unclear how
generalizable the ndings are to individuals at lower risk. Selection
of individuals for lung cancer screening based on high risk rather
than the NLST criteria (age 55 to 79 years,  30 pack-years
smoked,  15 years of time since quitting smoking) has been
shown to save more lives and to be more efcient.9 Thus, in the
future, candidates selected for lung screening may be similar to
those included in this study.

One of the strengths of our study is that it was prospective, with
biospecimens collected at study baseline when individuals had no
clinical history of lung cancer. One of the primary aims of the study
was to evaluate the use of thoracic CT for lung cancer screening. This
led to detailed and rigorous diagnostic assessment of individuals for
the study outcome, lung cancer. Known predictors of lung cancer
from previous risk prediction models were forced into models in this
study regardless of statistical signicance to attempt to truly test the
added incremental value of pro-SFTPB. In addition, we were able to
demonstrate the predictive ability of pro-SFTPB in two indepen-
dent cohorts.

The association between pro-SFTPB and NSCLC and the impor-
tant ability of pro-SFTPB to predict NSCLC needs to be further vali-
dated in different populations in well-designed prospective studies. If
current ndings are validated, it will be important to integrate pro-

SFTPB into a comprehensive NSCLC prediction model based on a
large sample with adequate numbers of outcomes. Once pro-SFTPB
becomes integrated into a comprehensive lung cancer prediction
model, it is expected to make important contributions to clinical and
public health practice and may lead to more efcient lung cancer
screening by improving enrollment criteria for identifying those who
would benet from screening.
