Abstract
Pancreatic cancer (PC) is a leading cause of cancer related deaths in United States. The lack of
early symptoms results in late-stage detection and a high mortality rate. Currently, the only
potentially curative approach for PC is surgical resection, which is often unsuccessful because the
invasive and metastatic nature of the tumor masses makes their complete removal difficult.
Consequently, patients suffer relapses from remaining cancer stem cells or drug resistance that
eventually lead to death. To improve the survival rate, the early detection of PC is critical.
Current biomarker research in PC indicates that a serum carbohydrate antigen, CA 19-9, is the
only available biomarker with approximately 90% specificity to PC. However, the efficacy of CA
19-9 for assessing prognosis and monitoring patients with PC remains contentious. Thus, advances
in technology and the detection of new biomarkers with high specificity to PC are needed to
reduce the mortality rate of pancreatic cancer.

INTRODUCTION
With a mortality rate of nearly 100 %, pancreatic cancer (PC) is one of the most lethal
malignancies [1] and it is the fourth most prominent cause for cancer-related deaths in both
men and women in the United States [2–3]. Even patients treated with current state-of-theart therapies have an overall 5-year survival rate of only 3% [4]. The main reason is that
approximately 80% of newly diagnosed patients are already in the metastatic stage of the
disease, for which no curative therapy is currently available [5–7].

Most patients with PC have no distinct clinical manifestations in their early stages of the
disease. Commonly described symptoms include pain in the upper abdominal region,
significant weight loss, heartburn, altered bowel habits, and obstructive jaundice [8].
Obstructive jaundice is the only symptom with some specificity for PC [9–12]. The
diagnosis of PC relies on biopsy and computed tomography (CT) and/or magnetic resonance
imaging (MRI) [13–14]. The diagnosis could be improved by using endoscopic ultrasound
(EUS) and positron emission tomography (PET) techniques [15–17]. Advanced technologies
such as magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) and endoscopic retrograde
cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) facilitate better detection of tumors at an early stage by
allowing a comprehensive and introspective analysis of the morphological changes of the
gland [18–20]. Other techniques like fine-needle aspiration (FNA) are useful for pinpointing
and retrieving biopsied specimens [21–22]. However, these techniques are not only costly
but also require access to highly advanced, specialized facilities (Table 1), and therefore
may not be readily available for detecting the disease at an early stage.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

At present, no curative therapies are available for patients with PC; the mainstay of
treatment with the potential for cure is the complete, eradicative surgical resection of the
primary carcinoma. Due to the lack of specific early-stage clinical symptoms and the highly
deleterious, aggressive nature of the evolving disease, patients are usually diagnosed at the
unresectable stages [23–24]. Consequently, the average survival of the resected patients is
approximately 12 to 20 months with a high probability of relapse [25–26]. Use of
gemcitabine (Gemzar®) or the combinations of gemcitabine with other cancer drugs, such as
oxalipatin, cisplatin or erlotinib has demonstrated efficacy in the treatment of PC [27–30].
The role of radiotherapy in PC treatment remains controversial [31], although
radiochemotherapy is increasingly accepted as a treatment modality for unresectable,
nonmetastatic PC [32–33]. Despite these advances, PC remains one of the most deadly
malignancies.

TUMOR ORIGIN AND PROGRESSION

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Although the exocrine pancreas consists of a very small ductal system, 90% of pancreatic
neoplasms (of which 80% are invasive adenocarcinomas) are ductal in origin, and the
remaining 10% are islet-cell and cystic tumors [1]. The etiology of PC remains unclear, but
several risk factors have been identified (Table 2). In general, individuals diagnosed with
diabetes or with a history of pancreatitis or chronic pancreatitis are at a risk for developing
PC [1, 34–35]. A history of smoking and/or alcoholism also increases the risk of PC [36–
38]. Recently, Peutz-Jeghers syndrome, single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), hereditary
pancreatitis, and a 5–10% family history of PC have also been added as PC risk factors [16,
35, 39].
More than 90% of PC patients acquire the disease sporadically; it is unclear how the normal
tissue is transformed to PC. Fig. (1) illustrates a Genetic Progression Model based on the
oncogenic markers in tumor tissues [1, 40–41]. In the model, normal pancreatic cells are
transformed to pre-malignant lesions termed pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PanINs) in
concomitance with a multitude of genetic changes and morphological dysplasia, named
PanIN-1a, PanIN-1b, PanIN-2, and PanIN-3 that collectively may be regarded as molecular
and structural antecedents to the eventual establishment of invasive adenocarcinoma [10,11].
Some of the most frequently detected genetic changes in the initial stages of PC include the
activation of mutated K-ras [42–44], the hypermethylation of preproenkephalin (ppENK)
[45–46], the over-expression of EGF-family ligands and receptors such as ERBB2 and
EGFR [47–49], the robust increase in the level of carcinoembryonic antigen-related cell
adhesion molecule 1 (biliary glycoprotein) (CEACAM1) [50], and the hyperphosphorylation
of Retinoblastoma protein (Rb) [51]. Most notably, some researchers hypothesize that the

activation of K-ras mutation signaling, leading to the overexpression of EGF-family ligands
and receptors such as ERBB2 and EGFR, plays a pivotal role in the initiation of PC [47–49].
During disease progression, the loss of tumor suppressor genes (e.g. p16, p53, SMAD4/
DPC4, BRCA2) has been identified at later stages of PanIN [52–58]. The over-expression of
a negative regulator of p53 called MDM2 occurs in coordination with the malignant
proliferation of PC [59–60]. These molecular changes and events as a whole promulgate the
hyperphosphorylation of Rb protein, which promotes cell cycle phase transition and leads to
uncontrolled cell division [51]. Along with tumor progression, the expression of CXCR4, a
chemokine receptor, and miR-155 also increases in PC especially in the PanIN-3 lesions [41,
61–62]. Further, the level of macrophage stimulating 1 receptor (MST1R), also termed
RON, is increasingly elevated in premalignant PanIN stages [63]. Additionally progressive
methylation in the promoter regions of LHX1, a transcriptional regulator and secreted
apoptosis related protein (SARP2), has also been reported in PanIN lesions [64–66]. The
aggressive stage of the tumor is also characterized by the appearance of abnormally
shortened telomere [67] and the abnormal fusion of chromosome ends, concurrent with
neoplastic progression of pancreatic cells [68].

ADVANCES IN PC BIOMARKER RESEARCH

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Improving the PC mortality rate necessitates the discovery of new tools for the early
detection, diagnosis, and monitoring of therapeutic efficacy. To provide a context, we
provide an overview of technological developments relevant to biomarker research and
biomarker identification in the early stages of PC.

TECHNOLOGIES FOR BIOMARKER DISCOVERY AND IDENTIFICATION

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Important technological innovations have been made in the past several decades to facilitate
biomarker identification. Microarray and quantitative RT-PCR or PCR are frequently used
to analyze the variations of RNA/microRNA or DNA in the tumor tissues and other types of
specimens from patients and healthy individuals [69–71]. Methylation-specific PCR (MSP)
and bisulfite-sequencing PCR (BSP) [72] have been used to analyze DNA from different
samples [73]. Gene expression profiling and tissue microarray (TMA) have been used to
identify novel cell-surface targets [36]. New equipment and techniques have been developed
to systematically search for protein markers in specimens, including differential in-gel
electrophoresis (DIGE), tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS), electron transfer dissociation
mass spectroscopy [74], surface-enhanced laser desorption/ionization (SELDI) [75–76],
reverse-phase protein array [74], enzyme linked immuno sorbent assay (ELISA), matrix
assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectroscopy (MALDI-TOF-MS),
and quantitative proteomics [77–78]. Advances in these technologies have provided
significant leads in search of potential biomarkers for PC (Table 3).

SOURCE OF BIOSPECIMENS IN BIOMARKER ANALYSIS
Sample source is important in the search for biomarkers to detect and diagnose early PC.
Pancreatic biopsy samples are reliable sources for diagnosis, and pancreatic fluid (known as
juice) from the pancreatic duct has recently been identified as an alternative source for
biomarker discovery [72, 79] because the juice contains PC-specific markers (DNA/RNA/
proteins and cancer cells) that are shed into the ductal lumen [79] (Table 4). Furthermore,
plasma/serum DNA/RNA/protein, disseminated tumor cells (DTC) and circulating tumor
cells (CTC) in the blood are also frequently used for biomarker detection. In addition, saliva
has also been exploited as a source of PC biomarkers and genes have been detected with
potential for classification of resectable PC [80]. A recent study has suggested that detection
of genetic markers such as K-ras and p53 in stool samples might enable the detection of

early PC [81]. Potential biomarkers for PC using various source materials and discovered
thus far are summarized in Table 4.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

BIOMARKERS
With the aid of new technologies and using a variety of sample sources, a wide array of
potential biomarkers for PC has been identified (Table 5).

GENETIC BIOMARKERS

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Based on the tumor progression model, multiple genetic alterations are involved in a stepwise manner in the development of PC and in most cases, genetic changes in the four genes
– K-ras, CDKN2A/p16, TP53, and SMAD4/DPC4 were detected in the PC patients [5, 22,
82–86]. Among these genetic changes, the K-ras mutation was most frequently detected
with 45%–100% frequency in the tumor tissue and a 77% frequency in the serum of patients
with PC or pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PAC) [22, 43, 87–88]. 50–75% patients with PAC
have mutations in TP53 [43, 89]. In addition to K-ras and TP53 mutations, the loss of p16
and DPC4 was also frequently detected in tumor tissue of PC patients and correlated with its
clinical relevance [84, 90–93]. The K-ras mutation was detected in the premalignant stage,
which suggested that the oncogenic gain of mutation in K-ras could be a potential marker
used for the early detection of cancer [94–96]. Other genetic alterations described in PC
occurring at a much lower frequency include BRCA2, TGFBR1, BAX, RB1, STK11,
hMLH1, hCDC4, MKK4, FancC, and AKT2 [94, 97–99]. Another biomarker Plectin-1 that
was highly expressed in the PanIN-3 tissues may be used to discriminate the primary from
metastatic PAC [100]. Studies using a functional genomics approach identified seven genes
from plasma – TNC, TFP1, TGFBI, SEL-IL, LICAM, WWTR1, and CDC4BPA – as
belonging to a category that was differentially regulated in PC versus normal samples.
Studies also suggested that tissue factor pathway inhibitor (TFPI) may have the potential to
be a candidate plasma PC biomarker [101–102]. It is worth noting that although genetic
alterations in oncogenes - K-ras, TP53, p16 can be detected in PC [103] and may have
diagnostic value in PC, they are not specific to PC and hence not suitable for the early
detection of this deadly malignant disease.

EPIGENETIC BIOMARKERS

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Epigenetic factors such as aberrations in DNA methylation, histone post-translational
modification, and chromatin remodeling could also be considered as tumorigenic biomarkers
[104]. Global methylation profiling on 150 CpG sites across 807 genes revealed that 289
CpG sites were differentially methylated between normal and PC, raising the possibility that
they have diagnostic and therapeutic values and implications [105]. Genome-wide profiling
of methylated promoters in 57 PC and 34 normal pancreatic samples identified excessive
methylation on the promoters of several genes, including MDF1, hsa-miR-9-1, ZNF415,
CNTAP2 and ELOVL4 in cancerous tissues [106]. Further, frequent epigenetic changes
have also been demonstrated in PC in RASSF1A, cyclin D2, ppENK, TFPI2, CDH13 and
secreted apoptosis related protein 2 (SARP2) [45, 64, 99, 107–115], suggesting that
epigenetic profiling of selected genes in tissue specimens could be used for PC diagnosis
and prognosis. A similar approach applied to the analysis of pancreatic juice showed that
over 1% in the methylation status of cyclin D2, ppENK, tissue factor pathway inhibitor
2(TFPI2), neuronal pentraxin-2(NPTX2) and forkhead box protein (E1FOXE1) could
predict PC with 82% sensitivity and 100% specificity [99]. The hypermethylation of NPTX2
and SARP2 in PC patients was recently confirmed [115–116]; similarly, methylation
profiling analysis of circulating plasma DNA in PC patients detected cyclin D2 and a few
other markers in PC patients [117]. Other epigenetic modifications potentially useful as

biomarkers for poor survival in resected PAC patients include low cellular levels of histone
H3 lysine 4 dimethylation (H3K4me2), histone H3 lysine 9 dimethylation (H3K9me2), and
histone H3 lysine 18 acetylation (H3K18ac) [118]. Epigenetic silencing of SIP1 and
hypermethylation and over-expression of miR-200a/200b in association with elevated
circulating miRs have been reported in PC [119].

MIRNA BIOMARKERS

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

miRNAs are short non-coding RNAs of approximately 22 nucleotides that have been shown
to regulate the expression of both oncogenes or tumor suppressor genes, as part of the
posttranscriptional gene silencing (PTGS) mechanism [120–124]. Recently, it was found
that the levels of certain tissue-specific miR-NAs, such as miR-216 and -217, were markedly
down-regulated in tumor tissues compared to matched normal controls [125]. Conversely,
the expression of miR-196 and -196a was significantly elevated in tumor tissues derived
from PAC patients compared to normal pancreatic specimens [125]. Moreover, miR-196a
was detected in the serum of PAC, and thus may have predictive potential regarding the
survival of PAC patients [126]. Other miRNA biomarker candidates include elevation in
circulating miR-210 for PC [127], miR-21 as an integral link to the precursor lesions of PAC
[128–130], and upregulation in an eight-miRNA panel (miR196a, miR-190, miR-186,
miR-221, miR-222, miR-200b, miR-15b, and miR-95) based on an RT-PCR analysis
involving 5 PC tissues and 3 PC cell lines spanning a total of 95 microRNAs [131].

OTHER BIOMARKERS
Beyond targeting genetic, epigenetic and miRNA markers in PC using primarily tumor
specimens, with some less well defined and specific changes detected in the serum and other
body fluids, several other PC biomarkers have been identified and are listed in Tables 5 & 6.
Among these, perhaps the one considered to have the most definitive diagnostic, prognostic,
and predictive value is carbohydrate antigen 19-9 (CA 19-9), which shows an 81%
sensitivity and 90% specificity [132–137].

CA 19-9

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Although first described as a tumor-associated carbohydrate antigen in 1979 by Koprowski
et al., [138–139], CA 19-9 is now known to be a sialylated Lea blood group antigen [140].
The nomenclature of CA 19-9 was compiled from the mucinous glycoprotein complex (such
as H-CanAg, L-CanAg, and MUC1) [133, 141] based on recognition of sialylated lacto-Nfucopentaose II epitope by the moloclonal antibody (1116-NS-19-9). The levels of CA 19-9
in the serum varied according to the patient's secretor status and Lewis genotype [139–140,
142–143]. Individuals who are Lewis blood type negative (Lea-b-) do not express the CA
19-9; hence, for those diagnosed with PC in this group (about 5% of the PC population),
elevation in CA19-9 is not observed because of deficiency of a fucosyltransferase essential
for the biosynthesis of CA19-9 and the Lewis antigen [144].
CA 19-9 was initially detected in colorectal cancer cell line SW1116 and colorectal tissues
[139] but its occurrence was subsequently extended to other organs such as pancreas,
stomach, and biliary epithelium [145]. Based on reports showing that the sialyl Lewisa
structure (NeuNAcα2-3Ga1β1-3Glc [4-Fucα1] NAcβl-3Galβl-4Glc) acts as a ligand for Eselectin [140, 146–148], Kannagi proposed that three factors should be taken into
consideration when predicting the risk of hematogenous metastasis in cancer patients: the
degree of sialyl Lewis a/x expression on cancer cells, the degree of E-selectin expression on
vessel walls, and the number of CTC in the bloodstream [147]. The concentration of CA
19-9 can be quantitatively determined by CA 19-9 ELISA [101]. Elevated levels (>37 U/ml)
of CA 19-9 have been associated with gastrointestinal carcinomas, particularly in PAC [144,
Curr Pharm Des. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2012 July 30.

Bhat et al.

149–151], and may be considered as a well characterized biomarker for PC (reviewed by
Duffy et al.) [152], and it is possible to predict the operability of pancreatic tumor in
patients. For instance, elevated levels of CA 19-9 (1000 U/ml) are correlated with patients
showing a tumor size >5cm in diameter [153]; only 5% of those patients have resectable
tumor [134, 153–154]. Other studies have shown that serum CA 19-9 concentrations greater
than 300 U/ml are indicative of unresectable PC tumors [155–156].

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

An increase in CA 19-9 levels may also be used to predict cancer progression while its
decrease is suggestive of favorable response to neodjuvant irradiation and chemotherapy
[157]. Steinberg compared CA 19-9 levels in 24 studies and found that CA 19-9 showed
81% sensitivity and 90% specificity for PC with a 37 U/ml cut-off [134]. Similar
conclusions were reached by Goonnetilleke and Siriwardena [158]. Taken together,
therefore, the immuno quantitation of CA 19-9 antigen is regarded to be the gold standard
for PC detection [152, 159]. Reservation in using CA 19-9 alone for PC diagnosis has been
raised by European Group of Tumor Markers (EGTM) [152, 160], and by the National
academy of Clinical Biochemistry (NACB) [152, 161]. Some noted caveats include:
elevated CA 19-9 can be similarly detected in non-malignant patients diagnosed with acute
and chronic pancreatitis, obstructive jaundice, and liver cirrhosis [134, 152, 162], and in
gastrointestinal carcinomas [134, 158, 162–163]; furthermore, false positive results may
result based on detection of a low molecular weight antigen, non-CA 19-9 [164]. Thus, the
European Group of Tumor Markers (EGTM) [152, 160] the National academy of Clinical
Biochemistry (NACB) recommend that CA 19-9 should not be the only indicator used for
diagnosing PC.
Other potential PC biomarkers include (1) elevation in MMP-7 in plasma and pancreatic
juice to discriminate between benign disease and carcinoma when combined with CA 19-9
[165], (2) a 2–10 fold increase in AGR2 in pancreatic juice, for the early detection of PC
[166], (3) changes in S100A6 in pancreatic juice, for early detection of the disease [167], (4)
elevated telomerase activity in pancreatic juice [168], (5) serine proteinase-2 (PRSS2) preprotein and pancreatic lipase related protein-1 (PLRP1) in pancreatic juice of PC patients
[72], and perineural invasion in PC [169]. Recently, a few studies have investigated whether
use of biomarker panels may enhance the specificity and improve the diagnosis of PC [170–
171]. The results showed that grouped biomarkers are comprised of CA 19-9, MCSF, CEA,
SAA, Haptoglobin, TSGF, CA 242, and HSP27 only showed comparable sensitivity and
specificity to single serum markers [170]; in contrast, combined assessment of CA 19-9,
ICAM-1, and OPG gave 78/94% sensitivity/specificity and represented a significant
improvement over individual CA 19-9 measurements for differentiating PC patients from
healthy controls and subjects diagnosed with benign disease [171].

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

CANCER STEM CELLS AND CTC
The prevention of tumor relapse in PC has not been successful [172–173]. The underlying
mechanisms are multi-faceted and may be attributed to drug resistance and insensitivity to
repeated treatments, as well as the presence of pancreatic cancer stem cells (CSC) [174]
which provide gain-of-function via their ability to undergo self-renewal, differentiation
[175], and metastasis [172]. Accordingly, several recent studies have confirmed the presence
of CTC in the blood stream and utilized CTC in the tumor tissue as a novel approach to
develop biomarkers for PC. Experiments have shown that the presence of CTC might prove
useful for prognosis in PC patients [176–178]. Although preliminary results from studies of
CSC and CTC are encouraging, the technologies required for the capture of CSC or CTC are
still at an early stage for routine application in PC diagnosis.

Likewise, mixed lymphocytes have shown promise for predicting patient’s outcome in PC.
For instance, an overall survival of 2.4 months was predicted in PC patients based on an
elevated neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio [179]; the elevated levels of micronuclei in
peripheral lymphocytes may have an association with PC risk [180]. Experimentally,
identity of mixed lymphocytes may be validated by the RT-PCR amplification of CK-19 in
blood [181]. However, the specificity of these measurements may be confounded by
innumerable factors that affect the lymphocyte populations in the blood stream.

FUTURE PERSPECTIVES

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

In conclusion, the establishment of early diagnostic biomarkers is critical to increase
survival of PC patients. So far, no single marker has been identified with the specificity and
reliability needed for screening PC during the early stages of the disease, even though a
wide array of serum and tissue-based candidate markers have been identified. Biomarkers in
body fluids have considerable potential for clinical diagnosis and prognosis; however, their
application is limited by their low concentration compared to what might be available in the
tumor tissue. The possibility that CA 19-9 may prove beneficial in diagnosing PC is
supported by its 90% specificity to PC, but its reliability is still open to debate. Furthermore,
more basic studies using cell lines, animal model experiment systems, and patient samples
will be required to better understand the PC biology as a necessary requisite to identify more
specific biomarkers for PC. The development of new methods to detect potential biomarkers
with higher specificity and accuracy even for low concentrations in the body fluids would
further advance biomarker research.
Promising new area for PC biomarker research and application lies in an in-depth analysis of
CTCs and CSCs. New technologies and approaches must be developed for isolating these
cells, keeping them in culture without changing their genotype or phenotype, and
understanding the roles which they might play in the genetic evolution of PC, will go a long
way in facilitating PC diagnosis and developing novel management and treatment strategies.
