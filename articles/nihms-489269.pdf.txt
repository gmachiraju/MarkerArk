Abstract

Using biomarkers to select the most at-risk population, to detect the disease while measurable and
yet not clinically apparent has been the goal of many investigations. Recent advances in molecular
strategies and analytic platforms, including genomics, epigenomics, proteomics, and
metabolomics, have identified increasing numbers of potential biomarkers in the blood, urine,
exhaled breath condensate, bronchial specimens, saliva, and sputum, but none have yet moved to
the clinical setting. Therefore, there is a recognized gap between the promise and the product
delivery in the cancer biomarker field. In this review, we define clinical contexts where risk and
diagnostic biomarkers may have use in the management of lung cancer, identify the most relevant
candidate biomarkers of early detection, provide their state of development, and finally discuss
critical aspects of study design in molecular biomarkers for early detection of lung cancer.

Introduction

Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related death in the United States (1). More than
60% of patients are diagnosed at advanced stages when a cure is unlikely (2). Five-year
survival rate for patients with advanced disease is less than 10%, whereas 5-year survival
rate in patients with stage I disease is greater than 70% (3). The annual mortality rate for
lung cancer exceeds the annual rate for breast, prostate, and colon cancer combined, all of
which have successful clinical screening tools for the detection of early-stage disease (4).
For this reason, the search for diagnostic strategies for early lung cancer detection has
intensified.

Until recently, the case for early detection in lung cancer was extrapolated from other
cancers such as colon and breast. Clinicians and scientists continued to hypothesize that the
earlier lung cancer is diagnosed, the opportunity for improved survival increases.
Historically, lung cancer has been difficult to detect early and thus survival advantages were

difficult to ascertain. In the 1970s and 1980s, chest x-ray and sputum cytology were tested in
screening trials for lung cancer. Although this approach increases the number of lung
cancers diagnosed, it did not improve lung cancerspecific mortality (5, 6). The Early Lung
Cancer Action Program (ELCAP) was a large lung cancer screening trial started in the
1990s using chest computed tomographic (CT) imaging (7). It showed an improved
detection rate and survival of early-stage lung cancers, which prompted the design of a large
randomized National Lung Screening Trial (NLST). Exciting results of the recently
completed study showed a 20% reduction in lung cancerspecific mortality using low-dose
CT screening for patients at high risk for lung cancer after a median follow up of 6.5 years,
compared with chest x-ray (8, 9). This is the first large randomized screening study of lung
cancer by low-dose chest CT to show an improvement in overall survival, thus giving new
hope in the survival for this cancer. Extrapolating from the NLST results, a screening
method that reduces lung cancerspecific mortality by 20% could save an estimated 11,074
lives annually in the United States., which is far greater than 2,303, the number currently
estimated to be saved with adjuvant chemotherapy (see Supplementary Data), therefore
providing a strong rationale to pursue efforts in early detection.

How do we define early detection?

Early detection involves a high-risk population, a screening test, and a testing schedule.
Within this context, one must distinguish populations of individuals at-risk before or after
the disease becomes measurable (Fig 1).

What clinical endpoints do the biomarker candidates of early detection address?

A distinction is made between risk biomarkers to assess the risk of developing lung cancer
(individuals at risk but with no measurable disease) and diagnostic biomarkers to determine
whether cancer is present (individuals at risk with measurable asymptomatic disease such as
lung nodules). Prognostic biomarkers in patients with early-stage disease can identify
individuals with an aggressive phenotype and shorter survival regardless of the type of
treatment provided and may help select populations who may benefit from adjuvant therapy.
Biomarkers of risk of developing lung cancer in the absence of measurable disease are only
discussed when originally developed as diagnostic biomarkers. The literature on biomarkers
of risk of developing lung cancer based on proteins or single-nucleotide polymorphism
(SNP) and including genome-wide association studies (GWAS) is beyond the scope of this
review. Likewise, prognostic biomarkers will not be discussed further.

What are the benchmarks for clinical utility?

To be useful in the clinical setting, biomarkers go through careful phases of development as
discussed below and should respond to specific criteria. The biomarkers should (i) be
quantifiable and reproducible, (ii) have good testing performance [with good positive
predictive value (PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV)], (iii) be measurable in
accessible material, in small amounts and with little preparation, (iv) indicate a disease state,
(v) have proven clinical use, (vi) be adopted by the community-at-large to take advantages
of the benefits testing affords, (vii) be cost-effective; and (viii) be reimbursed by health
insurers.

The Clinical Context of Early Detection

To be successful at improving lung cancer detection, biomarkers must address a specific
clinical question. Two pressing clinical needs are identified, biomarkers that will address the
risk of developing lung cancer and others that are diagnostic in nature and will distinguish
malignant from benign nodules.

The risk of developing lung cancer

Page 3

Biomarkers of risk for lung cancer have the potential to improve early detection beyond the
use of CT scans that suffer from lack of sensitivity (particularly among never-smokers),
specificity (high false-positive rate), and from high cost. Several published models exist that
predict an individual's risk of developing lung cancer (1015). These models were
developed to select patients who may benefit from additional radiographic screening.
Identifying a risk biomarker for developing lung cancer would further define the at-risk
population, decrease the overall number of screening CTs conducted, and ultimately limit
the downstream consequences of discovering these false positive nodules.

Distinguishing benign from malignant lung nodules

Diagnostic biomarkers that may assist in distinguishing a benign nodule from a malignant
one would be invaluable. Depending on geographic location, up to 30% of indeterminate
pulmonary nodules are ultimately found to have benign pathology when surgically resected
(16). In the NLST, 24% of patients who underwent a diagnostic operation (mediastinoscopy,
thoracoscopy, or thoracotomy) had benign disease (17). Thus, additional testing with a
biomarker could decrease the number of surgical resections for ultimately benign disease.
Current guidelines recommend that providers use models to assist with determining the
likelihood that a particular nodule identified by CT scan is malignant and thus should be
resected (18). However, as the use of low-dose CT for lung cancer screening evolves, better
predictive models that incorporate biomarkers would assist the clinical provider in
determining which patients have lung cancer. We recently validated a blood-based
proteomic signature for lung cancer diagnosis and showed that it may provide added value
to the clinical and imaging assessment of indeterminate lung nodules (19). Hopefully as
biomarkers are developed, they will assist in identifying not only those individuals without
malignancy but also help in determining those who are malignant and amenable to surgical
resection.

Current Status of Early Detection Biomarkers for Lung Cancer

We will review the most recent advances made to date in the field of molecular biomarkers
for risk assessment and diagnosis of lung cancer, as well as discuss the clinical use and
limitations of different approaches.

In an effort to identify the most relevant lung cancer biomarkers of early detection, we
selected published reports from PubMed on the basis of the keywords biomarkers, risk,
diagnosis, early detection, and lung cancer. To narrow our search, we further applied the
following 2 filters. First, the proposed marker, or panel of markers, must be quantitatively
measurable and its performance tested in at least one sample set of clinically relevant
specimens. Second, the report adhered to the PRoBE biomarker validation guidelines
discussed later. As a result, we have selected original reports summarized in Tables 1 to 3.
We recognize the limitation of selection, outcome reporting, and publication biases.

We have organized our report on the basis of specimen types, either tissue-based (Table 1)
or biofluids-based markers. We have further subcategorized biofluids-based biomarkers into
blood-based (Table 2), sputum, white blood cells, and peripheral blood cells (Table 3). The
phases of biomarker development are assessed following the Early Detection Research
Network (EDRN) classification (20). This classification was designed for biomarkers of
early detection in the context of screening and therefore may not directly address phases of
development of diagnostic biomarkers. These tables also include efforts from investigators
to integrate biomarkers in models of risk prediction or diagnosis. The validation sets
reported in the tables correspond to an attempt to test the biomarker (or signature) in a true

independent population, also described as clinical validation (4), to evaluate the performance
of the test.

Tissue-based candidate biomarkers

Numerous studies have adapted large-scale analytic approaches to profile the full spectrum
of molecular aberrations associated with lung cancer malignancy in tumors. These studies
have yielded valuable information that has unraveled several key molecular events of lung
cancer tumorigenesis, including mapping the genomic loci associated with high risk of
developing lung cancer, hypermethylation of a number of tumor suppressor genes (2125),
regions of chromosomal amplification (26, 27), mRNA expression variation (2831), the
differential expression of several microRNAs (32), and the proteomic signature of invasive
(33, 34) and preinvasive lesions in lung tissues (35, 36).

Several research groups, including ours, have been testing genetic and proteomic alterations
in surrogate tissues such as bronchial brushings and biopsies to determine the probability of
having lung cancer (2527, 36, 37), see Table 1. While this approach requires
bronchoscopy, molecular markers obtained from the airways may pair with the recently
proven CT screening to provide additional benefit when evaluating individuals at high risk
for lung cancer. Although much of the early biomarker discovery efforts have used fresh-
frozen samples as a primary source, acquiring these specimens is costly and laborious.
Because surgical pathology specimens stored as formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE)
blocks are widely available, many researchers are attempting to profile genomic and
proteomic aberrations in such specimens. Some of these aberrations include
hypermethylation of genes (38) and microRNA (miRNA) expression (39), which can be
successfully extracted as candidate biomarkers.

miRNAs are a class of small noncoding RNA genes that are thought to regulate gene
expression. They are abnormally expressed in several types of cancer (40, 41) and involved
in a variety of biologic and pathologic processes with tissue specificity (41, 42) with the
potential for clinical application (43). Another advantage of miRNA is that it is well
preserved in formalin-fixed tissue, making it ideal for use in routinely processed material
(44). Previous studies have identified differences in miRNA expression between squamous
cell carcinoma and adenocarcinoma in lung cancer (32), as well as in other cancers (42, 43,
45). The current trend toward using FFPE samples will allow for a greater number of
available samples and thus will increase statistical power and generalization of results.

Tissue-based biomarkers that reflect the molecular changes associated with specific
histologic subtypes of nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC) may provide the means to
differentiate tumors originating in the lung from metastases from other organ sites.
Furthermore, using immunohistochemical profiling of lung cancer tissue markers in
conjunction with well-established histologic examination can provide more accurate
subclassification of lung malignancies and thus may directly impact the clinical decision
making of antitumor therapy. The molecular changes associated with progression from
normal to malignant tissue may lead to the discovery of novel markers that can be detected
in circulation or other biofluids. Limited access to early-stage tumor tissue samples, tumor
heterogeneity combined with the complexity of the genome and the proteome, and the low
abundance of potential biomarkers represent some of the challenges that translational
researchers face when attempting to bring these biomarker candidates from the bench to the
bedside.

Therefore, the potential use of tissue-based biomarkers is highly dependent on the
accessibility of the specimens and the robustness of the assay offered. FFPE samples are
preferred by scientists because of their availability, but their molecular analyses remain

more challenging. Although noninvasive diagnostic approaches are also preferred, it may
take additional time to refine an airway epitheliumbased biomarker versus one that can
derive the same information from a less invasive sample. For example, developing surrogate
biomarkers of early-stage disease from tissues in the field of cancerization (bronchial
brushings or biopsies) may require testing in more proximal and less invasive samples (e.g.,
nasal epithelium). This problem may be less acute for prognostic biomarkers and biomarkers
predictive of response to therapy because tumor samples will be generally available for
analysis. Although molecular analysis of lung tumor tissues holds great promise to
revolutionize our understanding of the disease development and progression, tissue-based
biomarkers from the bronchial airway have significant limitations related to tissue
acquisition that may be overcome by the translation of that knowledge to more accessible
specimens and by guiding the development of biofluids-based early detection strategies.

Biofluids-based markers

The underlying premise of biofluids-based biomarker research is that molecular alterations
of tumor cells lead to the synthesis of distinct molecular species that can be detected in
biofluids. Biofluids-based detection strategies are an attractive approach for screening,
namely due to their ease of acquisition. Biofluids including peripheral blood and its
components (circulating cells, plasma, and serum), exhaled breath condensate (EBC), urine,
and sputum offer noninvasive access to large quantities of samples available for analysis.
These alterations can lead to the generation of disease-specific molecular species such as
altered or methylated DNA, overexpressed mRNA, miRNA, or proteins that can potentially
be released into the extracellular microenvironment. Therefore, molecular analyses of early-
stage lung cancer-related biofluids represent an attractive choice for the discovery and
validation of diagnostic biomarkers (46, 47).

Blood-based markersBlood is a complex and dynamic medium whose components
can reflect various physiologic or pathologic states such as the presence of some cancers.
Detectable moieties of the blood are currently the subject of many investigations and include
cellular elements such as circulating tumor cells (CTC), cell-free DNA and RNA, proteins,
peptides, and metabolites. Changes of the cell-free genomic components of the blood,
including DNA methylation (48, 49), DNA amplification, and gene expression (50), have
been reported in the circulation of patients with lung cancer. These candidates are reported
in Table 2.

microRNAsMore recently, miRNAs have also been identified in the blood of patients
with lung cancer (51, 52). In an effort to test the validity of miRNA as biomarkers able to
predict lung tumor development, diagnosis, and prognosis, an extensive miRNA profiling
was conducted in paired lung tumor and normal lung tissue and in plasma collected at the
time of diagnosis by spiral CT. A signature of 15 miRNAs present in the blood was able to
identify subjects at high risk of developing lung cancer in 2 independent cohorts of patient
with 80% sensitivity and 90% specificity (53). These results suggest that miRNA expression
ratios may be molecular predictors of lung cancer development and aggressiveness and may
have clinical implication for lung cancer management in the future. In a separate study, a
test included 34 serum miRNAs that could identify patients with early-stage NSCLCs in a
population of asymptomatic high-risk individuals with 80% accuracy (54). These
provocative results will have to be validated in independent cohorts.

Proteomic profilesRecent proteomic studies have focused on rapid proteomic profiling
of blood with minimal sample preparation. One of these approaches uses matrix-assisted
laser desorption/ionizationtime-of-flight/mass spectrometric (MALDI-TOF/MS) patterns
of abundant proteins or peptide fragments that correlate with early disease stage. Several

other studies used MALDI/MS to identify proteins and peptides in serum. For example, Patz
and colleagues were able to identify 4 differentially expressed serum proteins (transferrin,
retinol-binding protein, antitrypsin, and haptoglobin) that discriminate between NSCLCs
and controls (55). Using the same MALDI/MS approaches, several other groups including
ours (56) have reported serum protein expression profiles that distinguish patients with
various cancers from control subjects (57). Recently, we validated the proteomic signature
in 2 prospective cohorts of patients with lung nodules and showed that it may provide added
value to the clinical and imaging assessment of indeterminate lung nodules (19).

AutoantibodiesOther promising development in the blood biomarkers field is the
discovery of autoantibodies directed against tumor proteins. Alterations of the protein
production in cancer cells by overexpression, mutations, misfolding, truncation, or
proteolysis break immunologic tolerance and generate tumor-specific antigens which in turn
elicit a host immune response (58). Autoantibodies generated against these tumor-associated
antigens (TAA) during the course of disease progression can be further amplified by the
immune network, making them attractive candidates for the early detection and diagnosis of
cancer. Many TAA targets have been identified in patient sera in several immunologic
diseases and malignancies using high-throughput screening platforms, such as cDNA
expression libraries, phage display, and protein microarrays (59). For example, 2 separate
groups identified several potential immunoreactive peptides for autoantibodies using a T-7
cDNA-based phage library to screen the sera of patients with NSCLCs (60, 61). Using
similar techniques, Chen and colleagues also identified and validated ubiquilin-1 peptides as
a potential autoantibody target in lung adenocarcinoma from sera of patients with early-
stage lung cancer (62). More recently, Wu and colleagues reported the identification of 6
peptide clones discriminatory of NSCLCs using phage display techniques, but only one
protein has been confirmed (63). Recent improvements in blood fractionation techniques
and liquid chromatography led to the identification of several other autoantibodies (47).
Autoantibodies against known lung cancerassociated proteins such as autoantibodies
against p53, c-Myc, HER2, MUC1, CAGE, GBU4-5, NY-ESO-1 (64) or annexin I, PGP9.5,
and 14-3-3 theta, LAMAR1 (65), or IMPDH, PGAM1 and ANXA2 (66) have also been
reported as independent signatures. These recent autoantibody studies are particularly
provocative because some allow the detection of cancer-specific markers in the preclinical
phase of lung cancer progression. Similar to other circulating protein markers, the low
abundance of autoantibodies and the complexity of the blood proteome are still substantial
challenges facing these discovery efforts.

Circulating tumor cellsThe ability to capture and study CTCs is an emerging and
interesting development in the field that carries the potential to become a noninvasive tool
for early detection and diagnosis of cancer, measuring response to therapy, as well as for
understanding the basic biology of cancer progression and metastasis (6771). CTCs are rare
cells that originate from a malignancy and circulate freely in the peripheral blood. CTCs are
usually captured by immobilized antiepithelial cell adhesion molecule (EpCAM, also known
as TACSTD1) antibodies either in chip or bead platforms (72, 73). The technology of rare
CTCs capture is still in the early phase of development and requires more specific surface
markers to increase its spec-ificity for circulating lung cancer cells.

In summary, peripheral blood is a rich medium for cancer-specific markers from small
molecules such as miRNAs to whole cells, all of which represent a great opportunity for
developing a minimally invasive diagnostic test of lung cancer. Significant challenges are
still preventing the clinical success of blood markers, including the extreme complexity of
the blood matrix, the scarce quantity of any given marker, and the lack of sensitive,
reproducible, and high-throughput verification modalities, in particular in proteomics
research. New and innovative fractionation techniques, more sensitive and specific detection

reagents, and well-validated assays will increase our chances of capturing blood-based
biomarkers.

Exhaled breath condensateThe analysis of EBC represents another noninvasive
method of diagnosing lung cancer. The analysis of volatile organic compounds (VOC) that
are linked to cancer is likely to provide a novel opportunity for the identification of
diagnostic cancer biomarkers because such a large volume of sample can be collected easily
and inexpensively (7476). The underlying rationale of this approach is based on the
observation that tumor cell growth is accompanied by the alteration of protein expression
pattern that may lead to peroxidation of the cell membrane and thus to the emission of
VOCs (76). Several recent studies have used gas chromatography combined with mass
spectrometric analysis (GC-MS) of VOCs as both discovery and validation platforms (77
81). Other groups have used the analytic power of GC-MS and the sensitivity of custom-
designed nanosensors in which changes in electrical resistance from organic compounds
contained in exhaled breath of patients can be detected by these sensors and recorded. For
example, in a study by Peng and colleagues a VOC signature that distinguished patients with
lung, colorectal, and breast cancers from healthy individuals was recently identified from
exhaled alveolar breath (82). These candidates are reported in Table 3. Other studies
attempted to identify volatile proteins and peptides present in EBC and used them as
potential markers for the early detection of lung cancer (8385). The results of these studies
provide evidence for feasibility of this strategy to isolate and identify proteins useful for
early detection of lung cancer. Further studies are still needed to standardize a collection
device, to further show specificity of any test, and to determine the use of this approach in
clinical practice.

Sputum and urineCigarette smoking leads to the increased production of sputum with
glycoproteins, inflammatory cells, and exfoliated cells from the bronchial tree. Because
sputum is so readily available, particularly in current and ex-smokers, that its molecular
analysis has been an active area of research for lung cancer biomarkers (21). Although
detecting lung cancer using sputum cytology alone has low sensitivity (86), several studies
showed that combining cytology with analysis of genetic abnormalities improves diagnosis
accuracy. Several types of genetic abnormalities have been detected in the sputum of
patients with lung cancer, such as deletions of HYAL2, FHIT, and SFTPC (87),
chromosomal aneusomy (88, 89), DNA methylation (90, 91), and miRNA (92, 93). These
candidates are reported in Table 3. Also recently, measurements of genomic aneuploidy
when combined with pulmonary function can significantly improve lung cancer risk
prediction (94). The performance of most of these potential markers has not been tested in
large-scale validation studies, and whether these markers will add value to standardized
sputum cytology remains to be seen.

Urine, much like blood, EBC, and sputum, is another easily accessible biofluid that could be
an important source of cancer-specific markers. Some recent proof-of-principle studies have
attempted to profile the molecular changes of urine using mass spectrometric analysis. The
molecular species that were detected in urine include VOCs previously identified in an
animal model of lung cancer (95), and their investigation in patients with lung cancer is just
beginning (96).

Study Design for Early Detection Biomarkers Validation

Appropriate study design is crucial for the successful validation of a promising biomarker
for clinical use. Validation of a biomarker useful for lung cancer screening should be
conducted using a nested casecontrol study design within a prospective longitudinal cohort
following the PRoBE design (97). Specifically, random sampling of cases and controls

identified from within a well-defined cohort population allows both cases and controls to be
sampled from the same source population, thus providing validity to the casecontrol
design. Matching strategies may be considered, such as using incidence density sampling to
sample controls at the same time each case occurs, so that cases and controls are matched on
time. While there are advantages to matching, the potential pitfalls of matching should be
carefully considered before implementation (97, 98).

Generalizability of biomarkers to the appropriate clinical setting and populations is requisite
for a clinically useful biomarker. The prospective cohort from whom the cases and controls
are sampled must be representative of the targeted clinical population to which the
biomarker will be applied. Thus, the cohort study population should comprise individuals
with conditions found in the target population, such as inflammatory disease, granulomas, or
benign tumors, so that false-positives can be minimized and individuals developing lung
cancer can be differentiated from those not developing the disease (99).

Biospecimens necessary for biomarker development should be collected at the initiation of
the prospective cohort study, before ascertainment of lung cancer status (97), and potentially
over multiple time points if the biomarker changes with age and with progression to disease
(99). These biospecimens are then evaluated in patients who develop biopsy-proven cancer
(cases) and those who do not (controls) to develop a biomarker for clinical use as a cost-
efficient approach. Importantly, the outcome should be clearly defined (100), and the
biomarker assay development should be blinded to casecontrol status to avoid information
bias (97). To validate the usefulness of a biomarker for early detection of lung cancer,
diagnostic validation of the biomarker should be conducted in a different population than the
one in which the biomarker was developed. Finally, this should be followed by early
diagnosis validation using a screening trial with lung cancer mortality as the endpoint (101).

Assessing whether a biomarker has clinical validity requires estimation of sensitivity and
specificity, which can be summarized with the receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curve
(102). Two additional clinically relevant measures that can be measured by ROC include
NPV and PPV, which are estimated using sensitivity and specificity. These clinically
important indices describe the probability of developing or having disease given a positive
test. Estimates of PPV and NPV are influenced by the prevalence of the disease and
consequently will vary by patient age, target population, and disease stage. Merely targeting
the screening to a high-risk population based on demographic factors can alter the screening
test performance characteristics (103). Thus, for a biomarker to be clinically valid and
generalizable, the biomarker validation process must be applied to multiple populations
having different demographic characteristics for determining the clinical validity and use of
a biomarker.

The use of lung cancer diagnosis prediction models will grow as the models accuracy
improves. When a patient presents in the clinic and undergoes imaging, for example, CT
resulting in a detected pulmonary nodule, current predictive models for assessing lung
cancer malignancy include those developed by Cummings and colleagues (104), Gurney and
colleagues (105), Swensen and colleagues (106), and Gould and colleagues (18). However,
these models suffer from relatively poor accuracy in particular for indeterminate pulmonary
nodules and do not provide accurate prediction of malignancy among patients referred for
surgery (16). While these models may include predictors such as patient age, smoking
status, duration and intensity of smoking, cancer history, gender, race, asbestos exposure,
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)/emphysema, and pulmonary nodule
characteristics by CT (size, shape, density, and location), the addition of biomarkers may
provide additional classification accuracy to the current lung cancer malignancy prediction
models. Recent interest has focused on the potential for molecular tools to improve models

predicting lung cancer diagnosis, yet most studies have shown little improvement with
added gene expression profile in cytologically normal large airway epithelium obtained via
bronchoscopic brushings (28) or a serum proteomic profile in patients presenting with
pulmonary nodules (19). While molecular markers are not yet fully incorporated into lung
cancer malignancy prediction models, it is likely that a profile of molecular markers will be
necessary to be clinically useful as biomarkers for early detection of lung cancer (107).
Future development of predictive models should incorporate previously identified predictors
and newly identified biomarkers (100).

Current Challenges in Lung Cancer Biomarker Development and
Implementation

One of the main objectives of molecular medicine in lung cancer is to identify biomarkers
that discriminate between low- versus high-risk individuals and between benign and
malignant lung tumors. Ultimately, these biomarkers can potentially be translated to
noninvasive, simple, and reliable diagnostic tests for early detection of the disease. The
underlying assumption behind these efforts is that tumor-specific or overexpressed proteins
can be detected simply and accurately in complex clinical samples such as surrogate tissues
and biofluids. The intensive research in genomics and proteomics aimed at identifying these
biomarkers has yielded a large number of potential diagnostic biomarkers, although few
have progressed to the level of U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval for
diagnostics (108).

This disappointingly slow pace of lung cancer biomarkers discovery and validation is
attributed to a host of technologic and methodologic factors. The gap between promise and
product can partially be explained by the fact that the current discovery methods are neither
reliable nor efficient. One reason is that the current analytic technologies still suffer from the
limited power to detect low-abundant cancer markers against a high background of high-
abundance molecular species such as proteins in very complex matrices such as plasma or
serum. These low-abundance markers in biofluids may be the most promising cancer
biomarkers. Consequently, many of the best candidates may thus be missed during the
discovery phase.

Another quandary is the limited capacity to verify and validate analytically existing
candidate markers in a high-throughput manner. This is particularly true in proteomics
research. The lack of available quality reagents such as antibodies or methodologies to
translate the discovery of candidates in tissue specimens and measure their concentration in
the circulation remains an enormous challenge. Therefore, it is possible that biomarkers
have already been discovered but not yet validated. Furthermore, once a long list of
candidate biomarkers is compiled, no current standardized method exists for selecting those
that are most promising for systematic validation. In addition, the reproducibility of
biomarker data has been flawed because of the poor design [e.g., underrepresentation of
studies using a nested casecontrol design (ref. 97)], model overfitting, and the lack of
cross-validation and independent validation. Changing technology, low concentration of
signals combined with very few prospective studies, and a low incidence disease make the
area of biomarker research challenging.

Conclusions and Future Clinical Implications

The molecular analysis of a variety of biospecimens has allowed the discovery of relevant
candidate biomarkers and consequently the identification of novel proteins that may have a
role in the development of lung cancer. A high volume of data from multiple high-
throughput biochemical analyses of clinical material from -omics sources has been

accumulating at an exponential rate in the last few years, generating large number of
biomarker candidates. None of the published candidate biomarkers of risk or of lung cancer
diagnosis are ready for clinical use, and few have moved to phase III of biomarker
development. Lung cancer is recognized as a complex and heterogeneous disease, not only
at the biochemical level (genes, proteins, metabolites) but also at the tissue, organism, and
population level. There is a need for incorporating findings from multiple discovery
platforms into a mathematical framework that can improve our level of understanding of the
disease process. A biofluids-based molecular test may improve the selection of high-risk
individuals for CT screening, distinguish those with malignant nodules from benign lesions,
and identify patients with particularly aggressive cancer. Clinical benefit could include
further reductions in mortality and thus provide significant cost-savings to the health care
system.

Figure 1.
Clinical contexts for biomarker development in early detection of lung cancer. This diagram
illustrates 4 clinical contexts within 4 windows of time. The period during which lung
cancer is nonmeasurable and precedes the diagnosis characterizes the context of risk
assessment. It represents a long window of time during which the disease develops and
corresponds to an opportunity for chemoprevention. When the disease becomes measurable
but remains asymptomatic, we enter the context of early diagnosis. Two other clinical
contexts relate to clinical diagnosis, that is, when the disease is measurable and patients
symptomatic, and to detection of recurrence. These windows of time correspond to the
different contexts for which different biomarker targets can be developed. Adapted from
