ABSTRACT

Early detection remains the most promising approach to improve
long-term survival of patients with ovarian cancer. In a five-center case-
control study, serum proteomic expressions were analyzed on 153 patients
with invasive epithelial ovarian cancer, 42 with other ovarian cancers, 166
with benign pelvic masses, and 142 healthy women. Data from patients
with early stage ovarian cancer and healthy women at two centers were
analyzed independently and the results cross-validated to discover poten-
tial biomarkers. The results were validated using the samples from two of
the remaining centers. After protein identification, biomarkers for which
an immunoassay was available were tested on samples from the fifth
center, which included 41 healthy women, 41 patients with ovarian cancer,
and 20 each with breast, colon, and prostate cancers. Three biomarkers
were identified as follows: (a) apolipoprotein A1 (down-regulated in can-
cer); (b) a truncated form of transthyretin (down-regulated); and (c) a
cleavage fragment of inter--trypsin inhibitor heavy chain H4 (up-regu-
lated). In independent validation to detect early stage invasive epithelial
ovarian cancer from healthy controls, the sensitivity of a multivariate
model combining the three biomarkers and CA125 [74% (95% CI, 52
90%)] was higher than that of CA125 alone [65% (95% CI, 43 84%)] at
a matched specificity of 97% (95% CI, 89 100%). When compared at a
fixed sensitivity of 83% (95% CI, 6195%), the specificity of the model
[94% (95% CI, 8598%)] was significantly better than that of CA125
alone [52% (95% CI, 39  65%)]. These biomarkers demonstrated the
potential to improve the detection of early stage ovarian cancer.

INTRODUCTION

Despite progress in cancer therapy, ovarian cancer mortality has
remained virtually unchanged over the past two decades (1). Annually
in the United States alone, 23,000 women are diagnosed with the
disease and almost 14,000 women die from it (1). Given our knowl-
edge about the steep survival gradient relative to the stage at which the
disease is diagnosed, it is reasonable to suggest that early detection
remains the most promising approach to improve the long-term sur-
vival of ovarian cancer patients.

The relatively low prevalence (40 out of 100,000) of ovarian cancer
among postmenopausal women in the general population, the lack of
a clearly defined precursor lesion, and the high cost and possible
complications associated with surgical confirmatory procedures have
placed stringent requirements on any test intended for general popu-
lation screening. Currently, none of the existing serum markers, such
as CA125, CA 72 4, or macrophage colony-stimulating factor, can be

used individually for screening (2). Longitudinal studies are under
way in Europe, Japan, and the United States to evaluate screening
strategies using CA125 and/or transvaginal sonography (35) and
their impact on overall cancer mortality (6). Preliminary results have
shown encouraging evidence of a survival benefit among patients
diagnosed through a screening regimen (3).

Reports from retrospective studies have shown that multivariate
predictive models combining existing tumor markers improve cancer
detection (7, 8). Recent advances in genomic and proteomic profiling
technology have made it possible to apply computational methods to
detect changes in protein expressions and their association to disease
conditions, thereby hastening the identification of novel markers that
may contribute to multimarker combinations with better diagnostic
performance (9 13).

In this study, we hypothesized that comparison of protein expres-
sions of serum specimens from patients with early stage ovarian
cancer with those from healthy women could lead to the discovery of
candidate biomarkers for the detection of early stage ovarian cancer.
To ensure that the discovered biomarkers are truly associated with
ovarian cancer rather than the result of biases in samples, profiling
data of specimens from multiple institutions were used for cross-
comparison and independent validation. We additionally determined
the protein identities of the discovered biomarkers to allow for addi-
tional validation with independent methods and as a first step toward
understanding the pathways in which they may function.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Samples. The study involved a retrospective sample of 645 serum speci-
mens. All were collected with institutional approval. Proteomic profiles were
obtained from 503 specimens collected at four medical centers (M. D. Ander-
son Cancer Center, Duke University Medical Center, Groningen University
Hospital, the Netherlands, and the Royal Hospital for Women, Australia).
Among them, the cancer group consisted of 65 patients with stages I/II
invasive epithelial ovarian cancer, 88 patients with stages III/IV invasive
epithelial ovarian cancer, 28 patients with borderline tumors, and 14 patients
with recurrent disease, all optimally staged by pathologists based on Federation
Internationale des Gynaecologistes et Obstetristes criteria. Among the stages
I/II invasive cases, 20 were serous, 17 were mucinous, 15 were endometrioid,
8 were clear cell, 1 was carcinosarcoma, and 4 were mixed epithelial carci-
noma. The samples also included 166 patients with benign pelvic masses and
142 healthy donors as controls. All of the samples were collected before the
day of surgery or treatment, stored at 70C, and thawed immediately before
assay. CA125 levels had been obtained previously using a CA125II radioim-
munoassay (Centocor). The clinical characteristics and age distribution of the
proteomic profiling study population are summarized in Table 1.

In addition to the 503 specimens for proteomic profiling, 142 independent,
archived serum specimens collected for routine clinical laboratory testing at
the Johns Hopkins Medical Institutions were tested for levels of the identified
biomarkers for which an immunoassay test was available. The sample included
41 healthy women, 41 patients with late-stage ovarian cancer, and groups of 20
patients each with breast, colon, and prostate cancers. All of the samples were
processed promptly after collection and stored at 2 8C for a maximum of

48 h before freezing at 70C. CA125II assay was performed using a two-
site immunoenzymometric assay on the Tosoh AIA-600 II analyzer (Tosoh
Medics).

Proteomic Expression Profiling. The ProteinChip Biomarker System (Ci-
phergen Biosystems), a platform for surface-enhanced laser desorption/ioni-
zation time-of-flight mass spectrometry, was used for protein expression
profiling (14, 15). Samples from all of the centers were processed identically.
To increase the total number of detectable peaks, serum samples (20 l) were
first fractionated via anion exchange chromatography by stepwise pH gradient
elution (taken at pH 9/flow through, 7, 5, 4, 3, and organic solvent) using a
Biomek 2000 equipped with the ProteinChip Biomarker Integration Package
(Ciphergen Biosystems). A control sample of pooled human serum specimen
(Intergen) was used for data calibration between experiments. Aliquots of each
fraction were bound in triplicate with a randomized chip/spot allocation
scheme to IMAC3-Cu, SAX2, H50, and WCX2 ProteinChip arrays. The
energy absorbing molecule (crystallization matrix) for surface-enhanced laser
desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry, saturated sinapinic
acid dissolved in 50% acetonitrile/0.5% trifluoracetic acid, was applied
promptly. The spotted arrays were read on PBS II ProteinChip readers.
Instruments were monitored weekly for performance using insulin and immu-
noglobulin standards.

Spectra were externally calibrated, baseline subtracted, and normalized to
total ion current within m/z (mass/charge) range of 1.5150 kDa. Qualified
mass peaks (signal/noise 5; cluster mass window at 0.3%) within the m/z
range of 250 kDa were selected automatically. Logarithmic transformation
was applied to the peak intensity before analysis for biomarker discovery.
After biomarker discovery, the quality and intensity readings of the selected
peaks were manually reconfirmed from raw spectra.

Multicenter Study Design. The diagram in Fig. 1 describes the design of
this multicenter study and usage of samples for biomarker discovery, predic-
tive model construction, and independent validation. To minimize the possi-
bility of false discovery because of site-specific systematic biases from pre-
analytical variables, a key feature of the design is that for biomarker discovery,
the stage I/II ovarian cancer samples and healthy controls from Duke Univer-
sity Medical Center and Groningen University Hospital were analyzed sepa-
rately according to sites. Only those potential biomarkers that were deemed
statistically informative and shared the same up or down dysregulation patterns
in analyses of data from both sites were additionally validated using the
remaining samples at these two sites and all of the samples at the Royal
Hospital for Women and M. D. Anderson Cancer Center. Samples from Johns
Hopkins Medical Institutions were used only for additional independent con-
firmation by immunoassays. Because of insufficient specimen volume, the
immunoassays were not tested on the samples from the first four institutions.
Bioinformatics Analysis. The unified maximum separability analysis al-
gorithm implemented in the software ProPeak (3Z Informatics) was used to

analyze the peak intensity data and to select a subset of informative peaks. The
unified maximum separability analysis incorporates information from the
traditional multivariate statistical classification methods into the support vector
machine algorithm (16) to provide a robust approach to analyzing high-
dimensional expression data (12, 1719). Bootstrap was also applied to help to
identify peaks with a consistently high discriminatory power over multiple
resampled subpopulations.

Protein Identification. The discovered biomarkers were purified accord-
ing to individual biochemical properties using a series of protein separation
procedures including anion exchange, size exclusion, and reverse-phase chro-
matography followed by SDS-PAGE separation. To monitor the purification
process, healthy control samples were processed in parallel with the ovarian
cancer samples. During each of the iterations, the new fractions were profiled
on the same type of ProteinChip arrays used for discovery to monitor the
presence or absence of the biomarkers of interest. The purified biomarkers
were excised and digested with trypsin before being spotted onto NP20
ProteinChip arrays and read in a PBSII ProteinChip reader. The masses of the
proteolytic fragments were used for database searching with the ProFound
algorithm. For confirmation, the NP20 arrays containing the proteolytic frag-
ments were analyzed by collision-induced dissociation using a Q-STAR
MS/MS instrument (Applied Biosystems/MDS Sciex) equipped with a PCI
1000 ProteinChip Interface (Ciphergen Biosystems).

Multivariate Predictive Models. The profiling data from the two sites
used for biomarker discovery were combined and then divided randomly into
a training set and a test set for the derivation and testing of nonlinear
multivariate predictive models using nonlinear unified maximum separability
analysis. The derived models were then additionally evaluated, in the same
way as the individual biomarkers, on the independent validation data that were
not involved in biomarker discovery or model construction.

Statistical Analysis. The performance of the identified biomarkers in de-
tecting early stage ovarian cancer from healthy controls was evaluated by
descriptive statistics, Mann-Whitney U test or Kruskal-Wallis test, and re-
ceiver operating characteristic curves (ROCKIT; University of Chicago, Chi-
cago, IL; Ref. 20). Performance of the nonlinear multivariate predictive models
was compared with performance of the CA125 assay alone by receiver oper-
ating characteristic analysis and estimated sensitivity and specificity. All of the
statistical analyses were performed using Statistica 6.1 (Statsoft).

RESULTS

Biomarker Discovery and Identification. Three potential bio-
markers were discovered. Two of them were peaks from fraction pH
4 at m/z 12,828 and 28,043, both down-regulated in the cancer group,
and the third was from fraction pH 9/flow through at m/z 3,272,

up-regulated in the cancer group. All bound to the IMAC3-Cu (im-
mobilized metal affinity chromatography array charged with copper
ions) ProteinChip array (representative spectra in Fig. 2).

The m/z 28,043 peak was purified and identified as apolipoprotein
A1 (z score  2.38 using the ProFound algorithm; 59% coverage).
Three peptides were sequenced by tandem mass spectrometry and
confirmed this finding. The m/z 12,828 peak was purified and iden-
tified as a form of transthyretin (prealbumin; z-score 2.19; 91%
coverage). One of the peptides was sequenced by tandem mass spec-
trometry and confirmed this finding. The m/z 12,828 peak copurified
with a much more abundant m/z 13,900 peak, which was also iden-
tified as transthyretin. Immunoprecipitation and tandem mass spec-
trometry additionally determined that a truncated form of transthyretin
lacking the NH2-terminal 10 amino acids corresponded to the m/z
12,828 peak. The m/z 3,272 peak was purified from the pooled serum
of ovarian cancer patients and its sequence was determined to be
MNFRPGVLSSRQLGLPGPPDVPDHAAYHPF, a fragment span-
ning amino acids 660  689 of human inter- trypsin inhibitor, heavy
chain H4 (PK-120). This result was confirmed by the analysis of
pepsin digestion products of the marker.

Discriminatory Power of Individual Biomarkers. Table 2 pro-
vides the descriptive statistics (mean  SD, median) and results from
statistical tests of these three biomarkers between healthy controls and
ovarian cancer patients of different stage groups in the combined
discovery sets and in the independent validation set. Within the
discovery sets, the expression levels of the three biomarkers were
statistically significantly different between the healthy controls and
the early stage ovarian cancer patients (P  0.000001 for all of the
three markers). With the independent validation set, the two biomar-
kers at m/z 12,828 and m/z 28,043 retained their statistically discrim-
inatory power in detecting stage I/II ovarian cancer (P  0.000001

and P  0.000008, respectively). However, the biomarker at m/z
3,272, with its large within-group variances, had only a marginal
effect in separating healthy controls from epithelial ovarian cancer. In
Table 3, the distributions of the biomarkers are compared among
subgroups of the cancer samples based on stages, histological sub-
types, and age.

Fig. 3, AD, compares the discriminatory power of the individual
biomarkers with that of CA125, using receiver operating characteristic
analysis on data from patients with early stage ovarian cancer and
healthy controls. CA125 and m/z 12,828 performed comparably on
both the discovery and independent validation sets, whereas the other
two markers had a lower area-under-curve than CA125 in one or both
data sets. However, the estimated correlations among the three bi-
omarkers and CA125 were low (data not shown), suggesting the
possibility that they were complementary to each other and that a
multivariate approach might outperform the single assay of CA125.
Because 27% of the samples in the healthy controls were from
women age 50 or older compared with 61% of those in the early stage
ovarian cancer group, we were concerned that these markers might
reflect age-related changes. However, the differences between the
early stage cancer samples and the healthy controls in the discovery
data sets remained statistically significant in a multiple regression
after adjusting for difference in age (P  0.000001 for m/z 12,828 and
m/z 3,272; and P  0.0174 for m/z 28,043). In a stratified analysis,
there were no appreciable differences in biomarker values between
cancer patients of age 50 years and those below 50 years (Table 3).
Previous population-based studies have shown that levels of apoli-
poprotein A1 actually increase slightly with age (21, 22).

Multivariate Predictive Models. The two data sets used for bi-
omarker discovery were merged and then randomly divided into a
training set and a test set. The training set had 28 ovarian cancer cases

and 33 healthy controls, whereas the test set consisted of 29 cancer
cases and 46 controls. The training and test data sets retained only the
peak intensity values of the three discovered biomarkers and CA125
test results.

Two multivariate predictive models were constructed. The first
used only the three biomarkers as its input and the second used the
three biomarkers along with the CA125 level. Panels EH in Fig. 3
compare the overall diagnostic performance of the two models with
that of CA125 using receiver operating characteristic analysis, among
which are the superimposed views of both the empirical and fitted
receiver operating characteristic curves estimated using the healthy
control samples against all of the stage I/II epithelial ovarian cancer
samples (Fig. 3G) or the invasive stage I/II epithelial ovarian cancer
samples (Fig. 3H) in the independent validation data set.

Using cutoffs that maximized the sum of sensitivity and specificity on
the training data, these models were applied to the test data and the
independent validation data (Table 4). For discrimination between
healthy controls and stages I/II invasive ovarian cancer in the independent
validation set, the multivariate model using the three biomarkers and
CA125, at a sensitivity of 83% (95% CI, 6195%), had a specificity of

94% (95% CI, 8598%). This is statistically significantly better than
CA125 at the same sensitivity of 83% (with a cutoff of 11 units/ml),
which yielded a specificity of only 52% (95% CI, 3965%). On the other
hand, CA125 at the cutoff of 35 units/ml had a specificity of 97% (95%
CI, 89100%) and a corresponding sensitivity of 65% (95% CI, 43
84%). At the same fixed specificity, the multivariate model using the
three biomarkers and CA125 resulted in a sensitivity of 74% (95% CI,
5290%). The difference, however, is not statistically significant, par-
tially because of the few stage I/II invasive cases in the independent
validation set. Table 4 also lists in detail the estimated sensitivities or
specificities for individual diagnostic groups in the training set, test set,
and independent validation set.

It should be noted that the biomarkers, with the exception of m/z
3,272, as well as the two predictive models were moderately capable
of differentiating stages I/II invasive cancer from benign cases in the
independent validation set (P  0.002 and 0.09 for m/z 12,828 and
28,043, respectively; and P  0.02 and 0.03 for models without
CA125 and with CA125, respectively).

using a particle enhanced turbidimetric immunoassay performed on
the Dimension RxL Instrument (Dade-Behring; Table 5). The serum
levels of CA125 were up-regulated among the 41 patients with late-
stage ovarian cancer compared with the 41 healthy controls
(mean  SD in units/ml, 2388  4723 versus 18  23,
P  0.000000), whereas levels of apolipoprotein A1 and transthyretin
were down-regulated (mean  SD in mg/dl, 122  42 versus
153  28, P  0.0004, and 20  7 versus 27  6, P  0.00005,
respectively). The mean serum apolipoprotein A1 level among the
healthy controls was not significantly different from that of patients
with breast or colorectal cancer (P  0.77 and P  0.69, respectively)
and only marginally different from that of patients with prostate
cancer (P  0.02). The mean serum transthyretin level was down-
regulated among patients with colorectal cancer (P  0.01) albeit to
a lesser degree than that in patients with ovarian cancer. The differ-
ences in mean serum transthyretin levels between the healthy controls
and patients with breast or prostate cancer were not significant
(P  0.51 and P  0.22, respectively).

DISCUSSION

Differential analysis of serum protein profiles from patients with
early stage ovarian cancer and healthy women revealed three biomar-
kers the discriminatory power of which was confirmed with samples

from multiple institutions through cross-validation and independent
validation. Combined with CA125 in a multivariate predictive model,
these biomarkers improve significantly on the specificity of CA125
alone although maintaining a relatively high sensitivity. Two of the
markers were also evaluated using immunoassays. Although the im-
munoassay for transthyretin was not specific for the particular trun-
cated form that corresponds to the m/z 12,828 peak, the results
corroborated the findings from the surface-enhanced laser desorption/
ionization mass spectrum data and provided preliminary analysis of
tumor site specificity of these two markers.

Results from receiver operating characteristic curve analysis (Fig.
3, G and H) show that at a fixed high sensitivity, the predictive
models, with or without CA125 as one of its inputs, had a much-
improved specificity over that of CA125 alone. However, when the
models were compared with CA125 at a fixed high specificity, the
improvement in sensitivity was more moderate and tended to diminish
as specificity approached 98% and above. The level of analytical
variability in peak intensity measurement relative to the few early
stage ovarian cancer cases in the independent validation set made it
difficult to evaluate in a statistically meaningful way the diagnostic
performance of the individual biomarkers or the multivariate models
at extreme specificity or sensitivity values.

The differences in area-under-curve in detecting stage I/II invasive
cancer from healthy controls were not statistically significant for the
independent validation set. Given the fairly large absolute differences

in area-under-curve, a likely reason would be the relatively few stage
I/II invasive cases available.

Serum levels of CA125 have been used widely for distinguishing
benign from malignant pelvic masses and for monitoring the clinical
course of patients with ovarian cancer. However, CA125 is elevated in
only about half of stage I/II ovarian cancer patients (23). Lowering the
cutoff of CA125 would increase its sensitivity in detecting stage I/II
cancer but result in many false positives in patients with benign
conditions as well as in healthy women. The improvement in sensi-
tivity by the multivariate models to detect early stage cancer also
increased the false-positive rate among patients with benign pelvic
masses, but unlike with CA125, it did not lead to appreciable con-
comitant loss of specificity among healthy women. At a sensitivity of
83% and specificity of 94%, the current multivariate model by itself
is not suitable for general population screening. However, in a two-
stage approach with a combination of a serum test followed by
sonography, a high specificity might be reached at an acceptable total
cost.

The identified biomarkers have been characterized generally as

acute-phase reactants. The down-regulation of transthyretin and apo-
lipoprotein A1 in ovarian cancer patients suggests the possibility that
they are byproducts of the host response to the tumor. Although recent
data have supported the concept that inflammation is a critical com-
ponent of tumor progression (24), such acute-phase reactants may still
represent only epiphenomena because of the presence of tumor and
may not be specific to a particular type of cancer (25, 26). In this
study, with preliminary data from immunoassays analysis, we were
able to verify that the levels of apolipoprotein A1 were not altered in
the serum of breast or colon cancer patients and the levels of trans-
thyretin were not altered in the serum of breast or prostate cancer
patients.

Transthyretin and lipoprotein(a) have been separately reported to be
decreased in epithelial ovarian cancer (27, 28). Transthyretin is the
major carrier for serum thyroxine and tri-iodothyronine and facilitates
the transport of retinol via its interaction with retinol binding protein.
Transgenic mice lacking transthyretin expression have dramatically
lower levels of retinol and retinol binding protein, and decreased
levels of retinol binding protein as well as cellular retinol binding

protein have been shown to be associated with an increased rate of
malignant transformation of ovarian epithelium (29, 30). In addition,
levels of cellular retinal binding proteins have been reported to be
changed in ovarian cancer by oligonucleotide array analysis (31) and
have been shown to be decreased in approximately one-third of
ovarian cancers by immunohistochemistry (32).

The carboxyl portion of inter- trypsin inhibitor, heavy chain H4,
from which the m/z 3,272 biomarker is derived, has been shown to be
a substrate for plasma kallikrein (33, 34). The fragment that we
identified as a biomarker differs from the postulated fragment derived
from cleavage by plasma kallikrein, suggesting a different protease is
responsible for the generation of this biomarker. Kallikrein proteases
consist of plasma kallikrein and tissue kallikreins, which have over-
lapping substrate specificity (35). The tissue kallikreins are products
of a large multigene family that includes prostate specific antigen
(hK3), a tumor marker for prostate cancer. Gene expression of seven
of the tissue kallikreins has been found to be up-regulated in ovarian
cancer patients, and expression of hK6, hK10, and hK11 has been
found to be increased in 50% of patients with ovarian cancer
(36, 37).

The identified proteins associated with the three biomarkers are all
of high abundance in serum and are unlikely to be released by tumor
cells. This limitation has been pointed out previously as being com-
mon among studies using mass spectrometry based proteomic profil-
ing (25, 26, 38). However, this is not purely a limitation of the mass
spectrometry technological platforms, but rather reflects the limitation
of high throughput sample preprocessing technologies that would
allow us to examine subsets of the serum proteome without introduc-

ing additional significant analytical variability. The use of sample
prefractionation in addition to multiple array surfaces in this study is
a first attempt in surface-enhanced laser desorption/ionization mass
spectrometry based clinical proteomics for biomarker discovery.

Two of the markers found in this study are cleavage products of
precursor proteins and present in the serum at a fraction of the
concentrations of their corresponding full-length proteins. Neither of
these truncation products has been reported previously, indicating that
they are new candidate markers. These markers may be the product of
cleavage by one or more proteases, including plasma kallikrein, tissue
kallikreins, matrix metalloproteases, or prostasin, a trypsin-like serine
protease that was reported recently to be increased in cases of ovarian
cancer (39). The proteases that generate these markers may them-
selves act as markers that can be combined with those discovered here
in a predictive model. More generally,
the
increasing body of evidence indicating alterations in the balance of
protease and protease inhibitor activity in the serum and tissue of
patients with cancer (40, 41). Preliminary results from additional
immunoprecipitation pull-down analysis suggest that the forms and
relative frequencies of posttranslational modifications of inter- tryp-
sin inhibitor, heavy chain H4 and transthyretin may be associated with
the ovarian cancer disease status (data not shown).

these results support

The use of proteomics to identify potential biomarkers has been
explored previously for the detection of a number of cancers including
prostate (13, 42 44), colon (45), bladder (46), breast (12), and ovarian
(9, 17). For example, Petricoin et al. reported the use of self-organiz-
ing map coupled with genetic algorithm to search through raw mass
spectrum data for informative variables and to form clusters of train-

ing samples as the basis of a predictive model. More recently, Kozak
et al. (47) reported several panels of selected surface-enhanced laser
desorption/ionization peaks for the detection of ovarian cancer. A
number of these peaks and their expression patterns are consistent
with those from our current or previous results (17).

Biomarker discovery using clinical proteomics involves the simul-
taneous analysis of expression levels of many proteins measured on a
relatively few clinical samples. The difficulty in statistical analysis is
complicated additionally by the possibility of nondisease-related bi-
ases and variability in data from preanalytical and analytical variables
and within-group heterogeneity associated with clinical samples. A
major concern has always been whether the discovered biomarkers
and the derived multivariate models are truly associated with the
disease process. Recent reports examined and highlighted the danger
of such issues (26, 38, 48). The current study had a number of features
that were designed to alleviate the impact of these factors. First, only
the intensities of detectable peaks were used in analysis, which in
general are less sensitive to mass shift in raw spectrum data, and the
discovered biomarkers are more likely to have an identifiable biolog-
ical identity. Second, biomarker discovery and construction of pre-
dictive models were done in two separate stages. During the discovery
stage, only linear models were used to evaluate the informativeness of
individual peaks. The bootstrap resampling was used to additionally
ensure that the peak selection results are robust among multiple
subpopulations. It was only after a small group of biomarkers had
been selected and individually validated across the multiple data sets
that the more complicated nonlinear unified maximum separability
analysis predictive models were derived to combine the multiple
markers. It would have been difficult to explain and validate the exact
roles of individual inputs if we had started the peak selection directly
with a complex nonlinear model using raw spectrum data. Third, in
this study, the data sets from multiple sites were used separately to
cross-validate discoveries from other data sets and to detect system-
atic biases in data such as those because of differences in preanalytical
sample processing procedures. This differs significantly from the
approaches in which data from multiple sites are pooled together and
then divided through randomization into (artificially made) identically
distributed training and test data sets. Considering the high cost
associated with post discovery validation, however, we believe that
the conservative approach that we used is more close to the real
clinical environment and appropriate for biomarker discovery through
expression profiling. Finally,
the identification of the discovered
biomarkers allowed additional confirmation through immunoassay
tests.

Previous studies have illustrated the benefits of combining multiple
markers and the longitudinal use of tumor markers in the detection of
ovarian cancers (8, 49, 50). New biomarkers derived from proteomic
analysis of clinical samples, once validated, may provide additional
choices in the selection of an optimal panel of markers that, through
a multivariate approach, would be capable of detecting early stage
ovarian cancer in a more general population. Studies remain to be
performed to evaluate these markers individually and in combination
in larger populations and, most importantly, in preclinical samples
from women with ovarian cancer obtained in screening trials. It
should be pointed out, however, that intensity data from mass spectra
measure the relative abundance of proteins. In this study, all of the
surface-enhanced laser desorption/ionization data were generated un-
der well-controlled conditions, with which we were able to demon-
strate the performance of the combined three markers and their
complementary value to CA125, using samples across multiple sites.
The successful application of the multivariate predictive models to
new clinical samples, however, will require additional work to assure
the consistency of measured peak intensities between multiple runs

and across different instruments and sites. Knowledge of the identities
of the biomarkers will certainly help to expedite future development
of assays.
