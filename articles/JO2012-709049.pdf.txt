Despite the widespread use of conventional and contemporary methods to detect ovarian cancer development, ovarian cancer
remains a common and commonly fatal gynecological malignancy. The identication and validation of early detection biomarkers
highly specic to ovarian cancer, which would permit development of minimally invasive screening methods for detecting
early onset of the disease, are urgently needed. Current practices for early detection of ovarian cancer include transvaginal
ultrasonography, biomarker analysis, or a combination of both. In this paper we review recent research on novel and robust
biomarkers for early detection of ovarian cancer and provide specic details on their contributions to tumorigenesis. Promising
biomarkers for early detection of ovarian cancer include KLK6/7, GSTT1, PRSS8, FOLR1, ALDH1, and miRNAs.

1. Introduction

Among gynecological malignancies, morbidity and mortality
rates are higher among ovarian carcinomas because early
detection is dicult due to the absence of recognizable
physical symptoms and a lack of sensitive screening methods.
In 2012, a total of 22,000 new cases and more than 15,000
deaths are expected, according to Cancer Facts and Figures,
2012, by the American cancer Society [1]. Despite avail-
ability of current screening measures, such as transvaginal
ultrasound, measurement of biomarker CA125 levels [2],
or a combination of both modalities, due to the highly
heterogeneous nature of ovarian cancer mortality rates
remain high. Although death rate has decreased by 1.9%
every year from 2004 to 2008, ovarian cancer still accounts
for 3% of all malignancies among women [1]. The long-
term survival rate is less than 30% for advanced stage
patients, but conventional surgery with chemotherapy can
cure about 90% of patients if diagnosed in stage I. Indeed,
if the malignancy arises in the ovary and is localized for
a sucient interval to permit eective screening, then the

chances for survival are signicantly higher [3]. Because
their anatomical location is deep down the pelvis, tumor-
related abnormal functioning of the ovaries is asymptomatic
until
the tumor becomes enlarged or disseminates. In
postmenopausal women, the problem is exacerbated because
ovaries become dysfunctional after menopause. Therefore,
ovarian cancer is more likely to be detected in an advanced
rather than an early stage [4]. Microarray analyses and pro-
teomics have been promising technologies used in research
to identify molecular signature biomarkers for early detec-
tion, disease classication, and prognosis of ovarian cancer.
Collections of heterogeneous neoplasms comprising ovarian
carcinomas have conventionally been classied based on
their type and degree of dierentiation. However, current
clinical management practices overlook the heterogeneity of
ovarian carcinoma [5]. Germline mutations in BRCA1 and
BRCA2 confer higher risk of ovarian cancer; the estimated
risk for BRCA1 mutation carriers range between 16% and
68% by age 70 and between 11% and 27% for BRCA2
mutation carriers [610]. If diagnosed at a localized stage, the
5 yr survival rate is 93%; however, only 15% of all cases

are detected at this stage. The majority of cases (63%) are
diagnosed after dissemination with the 1-, 5-, and 10-
year relative survival rates being 75%, 44%, and 35%,
respectively [1]. Clinical trials for identifying BRCA1 and
BRCA2 mutations in high risk populations are currently
being performed (Table 2). As described in earlier reviews,
both cytoreductive surgery and combination chemotherapy
with platinum-based compounds and taxanes did not change
the overall cure rate of ovarian cancer; however, the 5 yr
survival rate has increased from 37% (19741976) to 46%

(19992005) [11]. In order to improve long-term survival
of patients, to improve the clinical outcomes of ovarian
cancer and to obtain signicant reduction of risk, eective
early detection methods using screening biomarkers with
adequate sensitivity are urgently needed [12].

gold standard tumor biomarker, CA125, a high molecular
weight glycoprotein, has a sensitivity between 50% and 60%

women, and expression of CA125 is enhanced in 90% of
patients with epithelial ovarian cancer above normal levels
[1317]. CA125 is normally expressed in tissues derived from
Mullerian and coelomic epithelia and is the only biomarker
currently widely used in cancer therapy [18]. It was suggested
that CA125 can potentially be used for early detection of
ovarian cancer [19] since increased levels of CA125 may
precede clinical detection by more than a year. In addition,
analysis of CA125 levels has been useful
in monitoring
chemotherapy responses, distinguishing malignant pelvic
masses from benign masses, detection of recurrence, and
improving clinical trial design. A decline in expression
of CA125 is considered a favorable prognostic occurrence
during chemotherapy, and serial measurement of CA125
is used as an indicator of therapeutic outcomes and for
assessing stabilization of the disease [15, 20, 21]. However,
several factors undermine the signicance of CA125 as an
early detection biomarker. CA125 expression is absent in
about 20% of ovarian cancers, and CA125 expression is
elevated in some benign conditions such as liver cirrhosis,
endometriosis, and peritonitis. Also, CA125 levels exhibit
uctuations associated with menstrual cycle and pregnancy.
As a result, no CA125-based screening techniques are as yet
recommended for the general population. However, CA125
has been used eectively in concert with other markers to
increase its sensitivity as an early detection biomarker. In a
study by Tcherkassova et al., the receptor for circulating fetal
protein alpha-fetoprotein (RECAF), an oncofetal antigen,
has been examined as a biomarker for early detection of
ovarian cancer in conjunction with CA125 among healthy
women. When specicity was set at 100% (for each of the

individual markers), it was observed that the addition of
RECAF to CA125 enhanced the sensitivity of detection to
83%, as compared to 70% when using CA125 alone. For
stages III/IV the sensitivity increased from 79.6% to 88.2%
with the addition of RECAF, and a more profound increase
was observed for early detection of stages I/II (58.1% with
CA125 alone to 76% with RECAF/CA125) [22]. Therefore,
because of the relatively low sensitivity of CA125 as a
single screening biomarker, combining it with additional
biomarkers to create a multiple biomarker panel was more
eective; no single biomarker can provide all the neces-
sary information for ovarian cancer diagnosis and therapy.
Currently, various clinical trials are evaluating CA125 alone
or in combination with other biomarkers for screening of
ovarian cancer (Table 2) [2325]. It was demonstrated that
CA125 binds to E-cadherin and -catenin complexes, which
results in enhanced motility, migration, and invasiveness
of cells expressing CA125/MUC16 (Figures 1(a) and 1(b))
[26, 27]. As with some other ovarian cancer biomarkers,
CA125/MUC16 expressing cells signaling enhance epidermal
growth factor receptor (EGFR) activation, which results in
increasing its downstream eectors Akt and ERK1/2 and
in enhanced MMP-2 and MMP-9 expression [26]. Imple-
mentation of computer technology and statistical methods
in developing better detection and treatment capacity of
ovarian cancer has generated new tools that could boost
sensitivity of CA125. One is a computerized algorithm which
incorporates and straties an individuals age-specic risk
for ovarian cancer using CA125 prole; risk of ovarian
cancer algorithm (ROCA) increases the sensitivity of CA125
(86%) in preclinical detection. Using ROCA, it could be

4

predicted whether or not an individual is at high risk based
on the levels of CA125 (current and previous) as her age
progresses, meaning if the levels of CA125 increase as the
individual ages, ROCA identies the individual as at high
risk. Additionally, women with elevated levels of CA125 over
35 u/mL (which is considered as a threshold), which remain
unchanged over the years, are identied as at lower risk
(specicity 98%). Based on ROCA scores, women are thus
triaged into low risk, high risk, and intermediate risk and
referred for further procedures such as annuals, transvaginal
sonography (TVS), or repeated evaluations of CA125 levels,
respectively [2830]. Similarly, Ova1 is an FDA approved
multivariate index for identifying high risk ovarian tumors
before any surgical procedures. It combines measurements
of ve proteins CA125-II, apolipoprotein A1, transthyretin,
beta 2 microglobulin, and transferrin. Proprietary OvaCalc
software is used to interpret the results, and an Ova1 score
will be assigned which varies based on menopausal status.
Ova1 score 5 and 4.4 is considered with higher risk of malig-
nancy in premenopausal women and for postmenopausal,
respectively, with sensitivity of 92.5% and specicity 42.8%
in a trial conducted on women (n = 516) referred for
surgery by physicians [31]. In a recent study involving
590 women with dierent types of malignancies including
nonepithelial and epithelial ovarian cancers, malignancies
metastatic to the ovary, other pelvic cancers, and borderline
tumors, Ova1 demonstrated higher sensitivity compared to
physicians assessment or to CA125 prole and identied
the risk of malignancies when combined with physician
assessment before surgery. However, this study demonstrated
that Ova1 is independent of cancer stage and menopausal
status of women and has high sensitivity in detecting ovarian
cancer compared with CA125 and physician assessment [32].
It also demonstrated higher sensitivity in detecting ovarian
cancer compared with CA125 alone.

1.2. HE4 (Human Epididymis Protein 4). HE4 is a member
of the WFDC family of proteins (whey acidic four-disulde
core) and is found to be overexpressed in ovarian carci-
nomas. Normal functions of HE4 are yet to be identied;
however, the specicity and sensitivity of HE4 shows promise
as a serum marker for ovarian cancer in the early detection
process [33, 34]. Currently, the FDA has approved the
use of HE4 as a tumor marker for monitoring relapse or
progression of EOC (epithelial ovarian carcinoma) [35].
Earlier studies evaluated HE4 alone and in combination
with CA125 as a biomarker for ovarian cancer. The results
suggested that HE4 used in conjunction with CA125 yielded
signicantly greater specicity than either markers alone
[36]. Also, as a single marker, HE4 had the highest sensitivity
(72.9% at 95% specicity), and when combined with CA125
sensitivity increased to 76.4% (at 95% specicity). Among
biomarkers tested, HE4 levels demonstrated the highest
sensitivity for stage I disease, but was only 45.9% at 95%
specicity. There was no signicant change in sensitivity for
stage I disease when HE4 was combined with CA125 or with
other biomarkers. Thus, HE4 complements the ecacy of
CA125 in improving screening and diagnosis, and together
they comprise a promising biomarker panel for detection

and risk stratication of ovarian cancer [35, 3740]. Recent
research by Escudero et al. comparing tumor markers HE4
and CA125 in healthy individuals (n = 101), patients
with nonmalignant lesions (n = 535), and patients with
malignant tumors (n = 423) indicated that HE4 has higher
specicity in patients with benign gynecological disorders
than CA125. Similar results were obtained in patients with
renal failure or disease. However, the levels of CA125 were
higher in all nonovarian malignancies, and the results of
this study suggest that even though HE4 has a higher
diagnostic specicity than CA125, a combination of both
improves the early detection and diagnosis of ovarian cancer
of any histological type or stage [41]. In another study
conducted among Chinese women (n = 491), analysis of
HE4 and CA125 in sera from healthy subjects, patients with
nonmalignant disorders and ovarian cancer patients showed
that both CA125 and HE4 levels were elevated signicantly in
ovarian cancer patients compared to other groups, with the
specicity of HE4 ranging from 90% to 100% and CA125
from 36% (benign gynecologic disease) to 99%, attaining a
specicity of 100% for ovarian cancer with the combination
of both biomarkers [37]. Furthermore, in a model proposed
by Yurkovetsky et al. [42], a multibiomarker panel with
CA125, HE4, CEA, and VCAM-1 was highly recommended
for early detection of ovarian cancer with 86% sensitivity and
98% specicity. Overall, available data indicates that HE4
could be a novel biomarker for early detection of ovarian
cancer in high risk populations, and a multibiomarker panel
with CA125 would be promising in detection, diagnosis,
and prognosis. HE4 was shown to induce tumor cell
adhesion, migration, and growth through the EGFR-MAPK
signaling pathway (Figure 1(a)) [43]. In a recent attempt
to obtain a better detection tool, serum levels of HE4 and
CA125 were incorporated with menopausal status leading
to the development of ROMA (risk of ovarian malignancy
algorithm) in detecting ovarian cancer from benign pelvic
masses even in early stages. ROMA straties these patients
as high risk groups or low risk, based on ROMA score
(numerical) calculated from the predictive index [44]. Recent
studies demonstrated that ROMA exhibits high diagnostic
accuracy in predicting epithelial ovarian cancer from pelvic
masses. However, further research is required for evaluating
ROMA in early detection of ovarian cancer [45, 46].

1.3. Mesothelin. Several studies have demonstrated overex-
pression of mesothelin (a glycoprotein present on mesothe-
lial cells lining the pleura, peritoneum, and pericardium)
in most epithelial ovarian cancers and have suggested the
eligibility of mesothelin as a target for cancer therapy [47,
48]. Previously Scholler et al. demonstrated that cancer cells
undergo CA125/mesothelin dependent cell adhesion in the
mesothelial epithelium of peritoneum and conrmed CA125
and mesothelin mediate cell attachment [49]. Rump et al.
reported that, this mesothelin/CA125 interaction may also
play a role in peritoneal metastasis of ovarian cancer [50].
In a recent study, Lowe et al. evaluated personal factors such
as age, BMI, usage of talc, and smoking that inuence the
levels of expressions of mesothelin, CA125, and HE4 in high-
risk, healthy postmenopausal women and demonstrated that

Journal of Oncology

5

age is a signicant predictor in expression of mesothelin
and HE4 since levels of these biomarkers were found to be
increased in older women. Also, there was inverse correlation
between mesothelin levels and BMI of the subjects (>50 yr
n = 120, <50 yr n = 130) [51]. Similarly, a signicant
increase in levels of mesothelin in sera analyzed in normal
subjects, subjects with benign disorders, and subjects with
malignant ovarian tumors revealed that mesothelin could
be a novel biomarker and that higher levels denote poor
overall survival
in patients following optimal debulking
surgery or who have advanced stage ovarian cancer [52].
Moreover, 42% of patients with early stage ovarian cancer
had elevated mesothelin in urine compared to only 12% of
patients who had elevated mesothelin in serum, suggesting
the potential of mesothelin as an early detection biomarker
[53]. Also, McIntosh et al. noted that mesothelin and CA125
as a combined marker provided greater sensitivity for early
ovarian cancer diagnosis [19]. Cancer cells overexpressing
mesothelin demonstrated enhanced migration and metasta-
sis. These activities were mediated through MMP-7, which is
regulated through the ERK1/2, Akt, and JNK pathways. The
signaling pathway of mesothelin in ovarian cancer is detailed
in Figure 1(a), [54].

1.4. Kallikreins. The human kallikrein (KLK) gene family,
localized on chromosome 19q13.4, is composed of 15 genes
encoding low molecular mass serine proteases (30 KD)
of known or predicted trypsin-like or chymotrypsin-like
activity, which dysregulate dierent types of cancer including
ovarian, giving either a favorable or unfavorable prognosis
[5557]. KLKs are translated as preproenzymes and are
cleaved into proenzymes upon release from the secretion
pathway. Processing of the proenzymes into active extracel-
lular KLKs is mediated by KLKs or other proteases [58, 59].
Despite the fact that KLKs are involved in the regulation of
many physiological processes, including smooth muscle con-
tractions, hormonal regulation, vascular cell growth/repair,
and blood pressure, the role of KLKs in pathogenesis or
progression of cancer and diabetes remains unclear. The role
of KLKs in controlling cellular processes such as neovascu-
larization, apoptosis, and tumor metastasis by cleavage of
growth factors, extracellular matrix, or hormones has been
previously reported, and robust arteriogenesis induced by
overexpression of hK1 has been recently studied [6062].
KLKs function in numerous physiological and pathologi-
cal processes, including hormonal regulation [63], either
individually or in pathways. Their genetic polymorphisms
including sequence and splice variants are often associated
with increased risk for various types of cancers including
ovarian,
thus revealing the potential role of KLKs as
prognostic, diagnostic, and predictive biomarkers. KLK4-8,
KLK10-11, and KLK13-15 were shown to be upregulated in
ovarian tissue and serum from patients and were upregulated
in cell lines at the mRNA and/or protein level. Previous
studies reported that KLK4 (hK4) proteins are present in
normal prostate tissue and are secreted in seminal plasma;
however, higher levels of KLK4 expression are associated with
the progression of ovarian cancer, mainly late stage serous

epithelial-derived ovarian carcinomas where hK4 represents
a potential biomarker for diagnosis and prognosis [64, 65].

KLK4 and KLK5 were reported to be associated with poor
outcome in grade 1 and 2 tumors, indicating their association
with aggressive forms of cancer. The association of KLK4
with aggressive cancer was identied in an RT-PCR study
of KLK4 expression in 147 ovarian cancer tissue samples
[66, 67]. Similar patterns of expression were observed in the
levels of KLK5 with higher expression in aggressive serous
carcinomas compared to expression in normal ovarian
tissues or low grade tumors [68].

As demonstrated in Shan et al., KLK6 was reported to
be a novel biomarker for ovarian cancer diagnosis based on
the fact that it is associated with late stage, chemotherapy
responsive, disease-free survival and serous histotype [69,
70]. KLK6 has been identied as having high potential as
a novel biomarker with better specicity than CA125 for
early detection of ovarian cancer because it is not elevated
in noncancerous tumors [55]. Nonetheless, the diagnostic
sensitivity is low compared to the diagnostic sensitivity
of CA125. However, when KLK6 is used in combination
with CA125, the sensitivity of each of the biomarkers is
signicantly increased (at 90% specicity, sensitivity is 72%
for all patients and 42% in early stage patients) [55]. Using
an immune-uorometric assay KLK6 was found in high con-
centrations in various body uids including CSF, breast milk,
nipple aspirate uid, and breast cyst uid of women and in
male and female serum [71, 72]. However, the sensitivity
and specicity of both KLK6 and CA125 are ineective in
screening a population for early detection of ovarian cancer
[73]. The prognosis for patients with preoperative KLK6 lev-
els >4.4 g/L in serum is much worse than for patients with
lower preoperative KLK6 serum levels. The signicance of
KLK6 as a prognostic factor is higher than CA125. The exten-
sive and almost exclusive sialylation of KLK6 from malignant
ovarian cells suggests that sialylated KLK6 could serve as
a novel biomarker for early detection [74]. The signaling
pathway of KLK6 in ovarian cancer is given in Figure 1(a),
where its expression was found to be upregulated through
downstream pathways of k-ras. A component of the plasma
membrane Caveolae, CAV-1, was shown to be responsible for
KLK6 gene expression and related protein secretion [75].

Another important kallikrein family member, KLK7, a
chymotryptic serine protease previously reported to have
a role in the desquamation of plantar stratum corneum,
catalyzes the degradation of desmosomes in the deeper layers
of skin during reconstruction [76], thus playing a pivotal
role in cell shedding. Similarly, the presence of KLK7 on
the surface of cancer cells suggests that, by digestion of
extracellular matrix, KLK7 helps in the shedding of tumor
cells and, therefore, in invasion and early metastasis. The sig-
nicance of KLK7 in ovarian cancer early detection is directly
related to its upregulated levels in ovarian cancer cells [77].
In a study of 44 ovarian tumors (12 low malignant and 32
carcinomas), Tanimoto et al. [78] showed that levels of KLK7
mRNA were elevated in 66.7% of low malignant potential
tumor cells and in 78.1% of malignant cells, suggesting that
the overexpression of KLK7 in ovarian tumors contributes to
tumor cell growth and metastasis.

KLK8 is normally expressed in ovaries as well as in adult
and fetal kidneys, salivary gland, skin, tonsil, and breast. It is
also detected in breast milk and amniotic uid as well as in
CVF, CSF, and ovarian cancer ascites [79].

Analysis of kallikreins 48, 10, 11, 13, and 14 levels in
eusion supernatants obtained from 221 ovarian cancer
samples and nonneoplastic diseases demonstrated that,
with the exception of KLK4, all kallikreins were expressed
at higher than normal levels in ovarian cancer eusions.
Among these, KLK6, KLK7, KLK8, and KLK10 showed the
highest statistical signicance in ovarian cancer eusions
over other cancer groups, suggesting that these kallikreins
might be useful biomarkers in dierential diagnosis of
ovarian cancer [80]. In an analysis of kallikreins 6, 10, CA125,
and hemostatic markers and 5-year survival outcome from
epithelial ovarian carcinoma,
it was found that ovarian
carcinoma patients who lived past 60 months shared
similar elevated preoperative levels of KLK10 and CA125
seen among benign cyst patients. However, the authors
indicated a need for a further enlarged study to conrm
these ndings [81]. Results from an ovarian cancer xenograft
model suggest that KLK10 has a tumor suppressive function
[82]. Expression of KLK10 is noted in a variety of tissues,
including breast, ovary, colon, prostrate, and testes [83, 84].
The observed upregulation of KLKs in ovarian can-
cer is important for diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment.
KLK6, KLK10, and KLK11 may provide novel serological
diagnostic markers since their expression levels in serum
are signicantly higher in ovarian cancer patients than in
healthy subjects. Similarly, KLK4 and KLK9 share prognostic
value in ovarian cancer, with higher expression of KLK5
correlating with poor prognosis [66]. In recent studies,
we used a bioinformatics-guided approach coupled with
subsequent screening and validation methods for identifying
novel biomarkers for ovarian carcinoma. Our results showed
that KLK6 and KLK7 are upregulated in ovarian cancer
tissues over other cancer types. Upregulation occurs during
early stages and in ovarian carcinomas of low malignancy,
and these KLKs are secreted into the blood during tumor
progression [85]. Hence, KLK6/7 could be further evaluated
as early detection biomarkers.

1.5. PRSS8. Human prostasin (PRSS8), a trypsin-like pro-
teinase (40 KDa) localized on chromosome 16p11.2, was rst
isolated from seminal uid and was found to be localized or
secreted (or both bound and secreted) on the apical surface
of the epithelia of the lung, kidney, and prostate. Prostasin
plays a signicant role in activating epithelial sodium chan-
nels and suppressing the in vitro invasiveness of both prostate
and breast cancers [8688]. Similarly, epidermal tight junc-
tion formation and terminal dierentiation are connected
to the matriptase-prostasin proteolytic pathway [89]. Recent
studies showed that EGFR (epidermal growth factor recep-
tor) protein expression and EGF-induced phosphorylation of
Erk1/2 (extra cellular signal regulated kinases) were found to
be downregulated by prostasin expression in PC-3 prostate
cancer cells. Given that prostasin functions in EGFR signal
modulation, a recent study concluded that it was signicant
in the regulation of placental trophoblast cell proliferation

via the EGFR-MAPK signaling pathway, since this cascade
regulates placental cytotrophoblast proliferation [90].

The potential of prostasin/PRSS8 as a novel biomarker
for ovarian carcinoma was suggested by Mok et al. using
microarray technology to identify upregulated genes for
secretor proteins. The results demonstrated overexpression
of PRSS8 in malignant ovarian epithelial cells and stroma
compared to the normal ovarian tissue with sensitivity and
specicity of 92% and 94%, respectively [91]. A signicant
decline in postoperative serum levels of PRSS8 was observed
in a majority of cases. Similarly, Costa et al. demonstrated
signicantly higher over-expression of prostasin mRNA in
fresh-frozen ovarian cancer tissues than in normal controls
[92]. Previous studies to determine the function of Zinc-
nger protein 217 (ZNF217) using Aymetrix Gene Chip
analysis in the ovarian cancer cell line, HO-8910, with HG-
U133 plus 2.0 arrays demonstrated that silencing of the
ZNF217 gene resulted in downregulation (approximately 8-
fold) of 164 genes compared to normal cells. The same study
also conrmed downregulation of PRSS8 after silencing
ZNF217 expression indicating the signicance of ZNF217
as a key regulator [93] and suggesting PRSS8 as a potential
biomarker in ovarian carcinomas. The signaling pathway of
PRSS8 in ovarian cancer is detailed in Figure 1(a) [90, 94].

1.6. Glutathione S-Transferase Polymorphisms. Functional
polymorphisms of members of the Glutathione S-transferase
family (GSTM1, GSTT1, and GSTP1) are the result of large
deletions present in the structural gene, which in turn aect
drug metabolism and inuence the eects of chemotherapy
in cancer patients. Allelic variants of GSTs catalyze the
conjugation of glutathione to xenobiotic or endogenous
substrates, including potentially toxic chemical compounds,
and promote detoxication. Given that GST polymorphisms
are highly expressed in the human ovary [95] and that
polymorphisms of drug metabolizing enzymes inuence the
susceptibility to dierent types of cancer, studies on the role
of GST polymorphisms in the response to chemotherapy
in ovarian cancer therapy would be appropriate. Earlier
epidemiologic studies did not conrm the association of GST
polymorphisms with epithelial ovarian cancer [96], although
they suggested that individuals with homozygous deletions
of GSTM or GSTT have reduced or no GST activity, making
elimination of electrophilic carcinogens dicult. In a study
conducted by Beeghly et al. using DNA extracts from 215
primary epithelial ovarian cancer tissues, GSTT1, GSTM1,
and GSTP1 genotypes were identied and assessed by
multiplex PCR and PCR-RFLP. The study incorporated Cox
proportional hazards regression to determine the association
between GST polymorphisms and cancer progression. The
results indicated that although none of the individual GST
polymorphisms were associated with disease characteristics,
when adjusted for disease stage or limited to late-stage
patients, GSTM1 polymorphism conferred a better survival.
More signicantly, combination of no GSTM1 and low
GSTP1 resulted in over 60% better progression-free sur-
vival and nearly 40% improved overall survival. Therefore,
functional polymorphisms of GSTM1 and GSTP1 have
important roles in survival of the patients [97]. Similarly,

Journal of Oncology

a meta-analysis, by Economopoulos et al. examining the
association of GST polymorphisms and ovarian cancer risk,
suggested that GSTT1, GSTM1, and GSTP1 polymorphisms
did not seem to contribute any increased risk in individ-
uals. The study included 2357 cases and 3044 controls (8
studies) of GSTM1 null polymorphism, 1923 cases and
2759 controls (6 studies) of GSTT1 null polymorphism,
and 3 studies of GSTP1 Ile105Val. Because the populations
studied were largely white, the authors indicated that the
results could not be extrapolated to other populations,
and further race-specic analyses were needed [98]. The
role of GSTs is highly relevant in drug-resistant tumors
where higher expression of GSTs could alter regulation of
the kinase cascade during drug therapy [99]. Similarly, the
imbalance between GSH and related enzymes could lead
to various pathologies, including cancer, with the genetic
polymorphisms of GST aecting susceptibility and progres-
sion [99]. Signicant reduction in enzymatic activities and
higher risk for malignancies are observed in homozygous
null genotypes (deletion of GSTT1 or GSTM1 genes),
because the detoxifying abilities of these individuals are
low [100102]. In ovarian cancer patients with a double
null genotype, the observed prognosis was poor, along with
diminished response to chemotherapy; however, patients
with null genotypes for either GSTT1 or GSTM1 exhibited
an increased survival rate after chemotherapy for invasive
ovarian carcinoma [100102]. Considering these results, it
might be predicted that polymorphisms of GST (GSTT1 or
GSTM1) could provide a novel biomarker for early detection
and diagnosis of ovarian cancer, although further research is
necessary. The signaling pathway of GSTPs in cancer is given
in Figure 1(a), [103]. Although it is not yet clear what are the
signaling pathways of the dierent subtypes of GSTP, it was
suggested they may operate through the ERK pathway.

1.7. FOLR1. FOLR1 (folate receptor alpha) is a membrane-
bound receptor protein involved in transport of folate into
cells and other cellular processes. Over-expression of FOLR1
was observed in 69% of uterine serous carcinoma [104].
Rapidly dividing cancer cells have an increased requirement
for folate to maintain DNA synthesis, and as reviewed by
Kelemen, the expression of FOLR1 is regulated by depletion
of extracellular folate levels, accumulation of homocysteine,
steroid hormone levels, genetic mutations, and certain
transcription factors and cytosolic proteins [105]. Kelemen
discusses the signicance of folate levels in tumor etiology
and progression, with suggestions for future research in
FOLR1 gene expression and regulation [105]. Similarly, the
over-expression of FOLR1 in various nonmucinous tumors
of epithelial origin, including ovarian carcinoma, has been
reported; however,
its evaluation as a novel biomarker
for early detection has yet to be conrmed. FOLR1 over-
expression was conrmed in serous ovarian carcinoma in
previous studies detailing clinicopathologic features and
outcomes, as well as the relationship between FOLR1 and
chemoresistance [106]. This study evaluated 91 specimens of
serous ovarian carcinomas, and the results showed that over-
expression of FOLR1 is a poor prognostic factor for disease-
free survival and has a negative impact on overall survival of

patients. Moreover, FOLR1 regulated the expression of bcl-2
and Bax and inhibited cytotoxic drug-induced apoptosis in
in vitro apoptosis experiments. The results further support
that FOLR1 could be a potential biomarker in detection,
prognosis, and assessing chemotherapy responses of ovarian
carcinoma [106]. In a recent study by van Dam et al.,
expression of folate receptor-alpha was further examined
by using a detecting imaging agent, and intraoperative use
of a folate-targeted uorescence agent with uorescence
microscopy showed a strong signal for all folate-positive
malignant tumors and no signal
folate-negative
malignant tumors or benign lesions [107].

for all

Similarly, analysis of the diagnostic and prognostic role
of FOLR1 and FOLR3 in eusion cytology of ovarian cancer
(n = 71), breast cancer (n = 10), and malignant mesothe-
lioma (n = 10) using quantitative PCR and ow cytometry
showed signicantly higher concentrations of FOLR1 and
FOLR3 in ovarian carcinoma samples compared to breast
or mesothelioma. Furthermore, the high expression of folate
receptors in ovarian carcinomas shown in this study supports
the validity of FOLR1 as drug targets in chemotherapy of
ovarian cancer, since FOLR1 expression eectively dier-
entiates ovarian cancer tumors with its coexpression with
FOLR3, aecting the serosal cavities of tumors [108]. An ear-
lier study to evaluate the signicance of expression of folate
receptors in gynecologic tissues (ovary, uterus, and cervix) by
Wu et al. revealed contrasting expression patterns of FOLR1
between normal dierentiation and malignant transforma-
tions of these tissues using quantitative analysis of FOLR1
mRNA. Results indicated that in normal ovary, FOLR1
expression was limited to germinal epithelium, and down-
regulation of FOLR1 was noted in dierentiation of these
cells into benign mucinous or benign serous lesions. Sim-
ilarly, malignant transformation of these cells also resulted
in down regulation of FOLR1, with higher levels of mRNA
expression in serous cystadenocarcinoma [109]. Conse-
quently, these studies support the upregulation of FOLR1 in
ovarian cancer and conrm that it plays a signicant role in
regulating folate pathways in the tumor environment, mak-
ing FOLR1 a possible biomarker for early detection of ovar-
ian carcinoma. Clinical trials are currently being performed
to evaluate the potential of FOLR1 as an early detection
biomarker (Table 2). The dierence in levels of expression of
FOLR1 reported in recent studies is summarized in Table 4
[110113]. Nearly no information is available in regard to the
signaling pathway of FOLR1 in ovarian cancer, but it was sug-
gested it signals through p-53/lyn/Gi-3 (Figure 1(b)) [114].

1.8. miRNA. In addition to the above-mentioned biomark-
ers, epigenetic markers including microRNAs (miRNA) are
being considered as positive predictive biomarkers for the
clinical management of ovarian cancer [115]. Carcinogenesis
is a multistep process involving genetic alterations in onco-
genes such as deletions, mutations, or amplications and
changes in microRNA genes. Iorio et al. investigated the
importance of miRNA in ovarian cancer and demonstrated
that miR-21, miR-141, miR-200a, miR-200c, miR-200b, miR-
203, miR-205, and miR-214 could be used as diagnostic
markers in ovarian cancer [116]. Taylor et al. compared

these miRNA proles in circulating tumor exosomes isolated
from sera of both benign and malignant ovarian carcinoma
patients. The results showed miRNA proles in exosomal
microRNA from ovarian cancer patients were signicantly
dierent from the proles observed in patients with non-
malignant disorders, with no exosomal miRNA detected in
normal controls [117]. These results suggest that miRNA
proling could be a promising biomarker for early detection
of ovarian cancer and biopsy proling, as well as for
screening asymptomatic populations. Further research in
OVCAR3 cell lines showed higher levels of miR-21, miR-203,
and miR-205 in ovarian cancer compared to normal ovary.
miRNA levels were further increased when OVCAR3 cell
-deoxycytidine, sug-
lines were demethylated with 5-aza-2
gesting DNA hypomethylation as a possible reason for over-
expression of miRNA. This study indicates the pathogenetic
role of miRNA in epithelial ovarian cancer and supports
miRNA gene methylation as a possible epigenetic pathway
for their abnormal expression [116]. In addition, the role
of miRNAs in disease prognosis and prediction of outcome
in ovarian cancer has also been investigated by proling
miRNA expression from advanced cancer samples [118].
The results indicated that miR-200a, miR-200b, and miR-
429 play a role in cancer recurrence and overall survival and
demonstrated that low expression of miRNA 200 miRNAs in
this group predicts poor outcome, whereas high expression

(cid:4)

of miRNA 200 miRNAs inhibits ovarian cancer cell migra-
tion, possibly preventing metastasis, which might indicate a
better outcome [118]. The results discussed above indicate
that miRNAs are aberrantly expressed in ovarian carcinoma
and are potential biomarkers for early detection, diagnosis,
and monitoring the overall progress of the disease. miR-
214 was shown to operate through PI3K/AKT upregulation
via PTEN suppression, while it was suggested that miR-27A
in ovarian cancer signals through HIPK2 (Figures 1(a) and
1(b)) [119, 120].

1.9. ALDH1 (Aldehyde Dehydrogenase 1). Being a member
of aldehyde dehydrogenases protein family, ALDH1A1 plays
important role when expressed in a subpopulation of cells
with tumor-initiating properties in a variety of malignancies
and thus a possible candidate biomarker in cancer therapy.
ALDH1 is encoded by ALDH1A1 gene located in chro-
mosome 9q21 and plays key role in pyridine nucleotide-
dependent oxidation of aldehydes to respective carboxylic
acids. The role of ALDH1 in dierentiation of ovarian cancer
stem cells and association of ALDH1 expression and various
clinicopathologic factors including diagnosis, tumor grade,
chemoresponses, staging of disease, and overall survival and
disease-free survival of ovarian cancer was evaluated in
recent research by Chang et al., using microarray analysis
of ALDH1 (n = 442) by immune-histochemical staining

Journal of Oncology

as compared to the variations in clinical outcome. Results
demonstrated that ALDH1 expression was associated with
longer overall survival of the patients, and high expression
of ALDH1 is a favorable prognostic factor in patients with
ovarian cancer [121]. Similarly, recent study evaluating the
expression of ALDH1 in epithelial ovarian cancer stem cells
by Steensen et al. demonstrated the higher expression of
ALDH1 in CD44+ EOC stem cell clones [122] indicating
ALDH1 as a potential biomarker for identifying presence of
tumorigenic stem cells and improved therapy options.

Furthermore, tumorigenicity of stem cells coexpressing
ALDH1 and CD 133 was studied by Silva et al., who demon-
strated that tumor cells coexpressing ALDH1 and CD 133
have highly aggressive phenotype, rapid tumor formation
and propagation, worse progression free survival and overall
survival in ovarian cancer [123]. Considering these results,
which demonstrate that ALDH1A1-positive ovarian cancer
cells have increased tumorigenicity and higher chemoresis-
tance, it might be predicted that ALDH1A1, particularly
in a marker set, could be a possible biomarker for early
detection of ovarian carcinomas [111]. Recently reported
levels of expression of ALDHA1 in various ovarian cancers
are detailed in Table 3 [121, 124126]. The signaling pathway
of ALDH1 in ovarian cancer is shown in Figure 1(b) [127].

1.10. Other Relevant Biomarkers. Multianalyte-based ana-
lytical discovery platforms readily adaptable to clinical diag-
nostic screening tests are used currently to prole immune
responses against tumor-associated antigens. A goal is to
identify tumor-specic antibodies present before the devel-
opment of clinical symptoms that have potential for detect-
ing ovarian cancer. Such antitumor immune responses are
highly benecial in identifying ovarian cancer [128]. Simi-
larly, tumor vasculature also expresses signicant dierences
from its normal counterpart and is a source of unique
markers for detecting various malignancies including ovar-
ian cancer. By using immunohistochemistry-guided laser-
capture microdissection and genomewide transcriptional
proling for evaluating the dierential expression of genes
between tumor cells and normal ovarian tissues, studies have
revealed the potential of TVMs (tumor vascular markers)
as early detection biomarkers for ovarian cancer [129,
130]. Another potent early detection biomarkers for ovarian
cancer are glycans and their associated proteins and lipid
structures, which also vary between normal tissue and malig-
nant tumors. Glycosylation is a complex posttranslational
modication, and monitoring glycosylation changes provide
a more specic and sensitive method for identifying malig-
nancies including ovarian cancer [131, 132]. Microvesicles
or exosomes are membranous bodies released from tumor
cells and contain macromolecules including RNA, proteins,
and lipids. Current research is focusing on identifying tumor
exosomes as novel biomarkers for tumor environments
since tumor exosomes act as central mediators expressing
molecules involved in angiogenesis, stromal remodeling,
chemoresistance, activating signaling pathways, and inter-
cellular genetic exchanges [133]. Similarly, the eciency of
FDG-PET/CT (F-18 uorodeoxyglucose-positron emission
tomography) to visualize the increased glucose consumption

of malignant lesions, especially in ovarian cancer, is discussed
by Nowosinska et al. In that study, primary malignant tumors
could be detected with more accuracy than borderline
ovarian tumors; however, limitations included the inability
to dierentiate between benign and malignant pelvic masses.
This may be developed into a potential technique for early
detection of ovarian carcinoma and may have application
in management of patients [134]. In addition, osteopontin
(Figure 1(a)) [135] and B7-H4 have recently been identied
as early detection biomarkers for ovarian cancer. These
markers are undergoing further research for conrmation
[136138] (Table 1). A recent cell culture study revealed that
geometric mean of expression levels of osteopontin in epithe-
lial ovarian cancer cell lines is signicantly higher (270.4)
than healthy ovarian epithelial cell
lines (4.1). Similarly,
tissue level expression of osteopontin also varied from nor-
mal ovarian epithelial tissue (9) to epithelial ovarian cancer
tissue (164). Moreover, immune localization of osteopontin
showed higher levels of expression in borderline tumors than
benign tumors, suggesting the importance of osteopontin
as an early detection biomarker for ovarian cancer [138].
YKL-40, a glycoprotein in chitinase protein family, expresses
elevated levels in early and advanced stages of ovarian cancer.
Serum levels of YKL-40 from normal healthy individuals,
patients at high risk for developing ovarian cancer, and
ovarian cancer patients were assessed in a study by Dupont
et al. which demonstrated that higher levels of YKL-40 were
observed in stage I and stage II patients. Furthermore, YKL-
40 levels reliably predicted recurrent and advanced ovarian
cancer in these study cohorts since increased levels were
observed during advancement of disease [139] indicating
that YKL-40 may represent a potential biomarker for early
detection of ovarian cancer.

1.11. Genetic Biomarkers. Ovarian cancer, as any other can-
cers, arises from cells that acquire and accumulate DNA
sequence variations. Some of those sequence variations con-
fer the cells a growth advantage and lead to their uncon-
trolled proliferation (tumorigenesis), unchecked migration
(metastasis), and survival against various odds (drug resis-
tance). The advance of sequencing technology is making
it possible to uncover those genetic drivers and, thus,
identify genetic biomarkers to aid early detection, disease
subtyping, staging, and prediction of disease prognosis and
selection of eective therapy. The advancement in isolation
of small number of circulating tumor cells will eventually
make it possible to examine those genetic biomarkers early
noninvasively.

As the tip of iceberg, mutations in multiple genes invo-
lved in DNA damage repair, cell cycles, cell metabolism,
cell adhesions, and other pathways have been reported in
association with ovarian cancer. For example, germline
mutations in BRCA1, BRCA2, and Rad51D are well known
to increase ovarian cancer risk [142, 143]. Whole exome
sequencing of 489 high grade serous ovarian cancers (stage
II to IV) conrmed the involvement of BRCA1 and BRCA2,
with 8%-9% of tumor containing germline mutation and 3%
more containing somatic mutation in BRCA1 and BRCA2.
The study further identied other recurrently mutated genes,

10

Journal of Oncology

including TP53, RB1, NF1, FAT3, CS\MD3, GABRA6, and
CDK12. Specically, 96% of the 489 samples contain muta-
tions in TP53 [144]. While TP53 mutations are prevalent
in high grade serous cancers, KRAS and BRAF mutations
are more frequent in low-grade subtypes [145]. CTNNB1
(beta-catenin) mutations are common in endometrioid
carcinomas, PICK3CA mutations are most
in
clear cell carcinoma, and ARID1A (the AT-rich interactive
domain 1A) mutations are often observed in both tumor
types [146148]. We have taken advantage of semiconductor
sequencing technology, prepared DNA from 22 serous and
endometrioid tumor samples (1 FFPE slide per patient), and
sequenced 64 selected genes. With several thousandfold of
coverage, we have identied 9 other gene variants that occur
in 62%94% of patients (Li and Suh, unpublished data).

frequent

Whole transcriptome and exome sequencing revealed
that DICER1 mutations occur at high frequency in nonep-
ithelial ovarian cancers [149]. The mutations are clustered
at the metal binding site of the RNase IIIb domain, which
are critical for miRNA processing. As reviewed above in
section, miRNA themselves are increasingly being considered
as biomarkers for ovarian cancer development.

2. Summary

Despite all the conventional and current methods used to
detect ovarian cancer development, such as radiographic
imaging, invasive biopsies, tumor markers, and a combi-
nation of transvaginal ultrasounds with tumor markers,
ovarian cancer remains the most common gynecological
malignancy and has the highest mortality rate. The identi-
cation and validation of early detection biomarkers highly
specic to ovarian cancer are needed to establish minimally
invasive screening methods for detecting early onset of
ovarian cancer. Evaluation of promising biomarkers for early
detection opens new horizons in ovarian cancer detection
and therapy [150]. The analysis of
the human serum
proteome has provided better biomarker candidates for early
detection, an important goal, as early diagnosis improves the
ve-year survival rate over 90%. We discuss CA125, a tumor
marker with high discriminative power even before the
onset of symptoms, which has been demonstrated in many
ovarian cancer studies especially in postmenopausal women.
We note, however, that the increase in levels of CA125 in
other types of cancer, endometriosis, ovulation, other benign
ovarian diseases, as well as its low sensitivity in early stages,
limits its potential as a single biomarker for ovarian cancer
screening. Consequently, a multibiomarker panel aimed at
augmenting the sensitivity and specicity of CA125,
in
which CA125 is used with HE4, mesothelin (Table 1) [141],
CEA, VCAM-1, B7-H4, YKL-40, or dierent combinations
is under study for early detection. Of these, HE4 and
mesothelin are the most promising candidates to date. Addi-
tionally, screening for germline mutations in BRCA1/BRCA2
is also a promising method for early detection of ovarian
cancer in current clinical practice since high risk populations
with corresponding mutations could be genetically predis-
posed toward developing cancer. Prostasin (PRSS8), GSTT1,
FOLR1, KLK6, KLK7, and ALDH1 are all currently under

research and clinical trials (Table 2) and are also potential
biomarkers for early detection of ovarian cancer. Mok et
al. demonstrated the over-expression of PRSS8 in malignant
ovarian epithelial cells and stroma with sensitivity and speci-
city of 92% and 94%, respectively, and with a signicant
decline in serum postoperative levels. Similarly, evaluation
of GST functional polymorphisms (GSTT1, GSTM1) might
help in detecting ovarian cancer at early stages, since they
aect susceptibility and progression of cancer. However,
additional research is needed for conrmation of these
possibilities. Also, considering the fact that carriers of low
function GST genotypes (GSTT1 null, GSTM1 null) have a
strong survival benet, evaluation of GST polymorphisms
could be promising biomarker for early detection of ovarian
cancer. Similarly, over-expression of folate receptor-alpha
(FOLR1) in 90%95% nonmucinous tumors of epithelial
origin, including epithelial ovarian carcinoma (90%95%)
and serous tumors, indicates the possibility of FOLR1 as an
early detection biomarker and suggests the need for further
research for conrmation. Several studies demonstrate the
signicance of KLK6 and KLK7 in ovarian cancer, both being
highly expressed in ovarian malignant tumors from early
to advanced stages; however, the levels of these proteins in
serum samples analyzed at Hackensack University Medical
Center had the opposite signature, showing peaks in stage
I which declined toward advanced stages [85]. These data
support the classication of KLK6/7 as early detection
biomarkers. Similarly, small noncoding microRNAs acting
as epigenetic regulators cause post transcriptional silencing
of target genes and inhibit the activity of antioncogenic
pathways promoting tumorigenesis; the aberrant expression
of miRNAs has been demonstrated in several studies. Hausler
et al. demonstrated higher expression of miR-21, miR-141,
miR-200a, miR-200c, miR-200b, miR-203, miR-205, and
miR-214 and showed similarity in miRNA proling in exo-
somal microRNA from ovarian cancer patients, suggesting
that miRNA proling could be a promising biomarker for
early detection of ovarian cancer, biopsy proling, and for
screening asymptomatic populations (Table 1) [140]. Studies
have demonstrated that ALDH1-positive ovarian cancer cells
have increased tumorigenicity and higher chemoresistance;
therefore, it could be predicted that ALDH1, particularly in a
marker set, could be a possible biomarker for early detection
of ovarian carcinomas (Table 3).

In conclusion, the identication of novel and robust
biomarkers with higher specicity and sensitivity for early
detection of ovarian cancer could signicantly improve the
overall survival rate of ovarian cancer patients. The promis-
ing biomarkers in this category include KLK6/7, GSTT1,
FOLR1, ALDH1, and miRNAs, along with multibiomarker
panels in combination with CA125, which is widely used in
current practice.
