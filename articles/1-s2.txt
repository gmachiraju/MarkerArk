Oral cancer has a low ﬁve-year survival rate. Early detection of oral cancer could reduce the mortality and
morbidity associated with this disease. Saliva, which can be sampled non-invasively and is less complex
than blood, is a good potential source of oral cancer biomarkers. Proteomic analysis of saliva from oral
cancer patients and control subjects was performed to identify salivary biomarkers of early stage oral
cancer in humans. The protein proﬁle of pooled salivary samples from patients with oral squamous cell
carcinoma (OSCC) or OSCC-free control subjects was analyzed using two-dimensional gel electrophoresis
(2DE) and matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-ﬂight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS)
analyses. Potential biomarkers were veriﬁed by Western blotting and ELISA assays. Transferrin levels were
elevated in the saliva of OSCC patients as determined using 2DE followed by MALDI-TOF MS and conﬁrmed
by MALDI-TOF/TOF MS, Western blotting and ELISA. The increase in salivary transferrin levels in OSCC
patients strongly correlated with the size and stage of the tumor. The area under the receiver-operating
characteristics curves showed that salivary transferrin-based ELISA was highly speciﬁc, sensitive and
accurate for the early detection of oral cancer. We have identiﬁed salivary transferrin as a biomarker for
the detection of early stage oral cancer. This ﬁnding provides a promising basis for the development of a
non-invasive diagnostic test for early stage oral cancer.

1. Introduction
Oral cancer accounts for 2–3% of all malignancies [1]. There
are more than 300,000 patients newly diagnosed with oral cancer annually worldwide [2]. Squamous cell carcinoma accounts
for 90% of these cases [3]. Common risk factors for oral cancer
include tobacco, alcohol and chewing betel quid. The risks are
synergistic and might result in large areas of mucosal change or
stimulate carcinogenesis in the oral cavity [4,5]. Therefore, oral
cancer patients carry a high risk of developing a secondary can-

cer in the upper aerodigestive tract [6–9]. In accordance with the
multi-step theory of carcinogenesis, oral cancer develops from premalignant lesions and causes serial histological and clinical changes
[10]. Clinically, premalignant lesions might present as leukoplakia
or erythroplakia, but histologically these lesions have various manifestations such as hyperkeratosis, dysplasia, or even carcinoma
[10].
The ﬁve-year survival rate of patients suffering from oral cancer is as low as 50%, and has not improved signiﬁcantly in recent
decades, despite advances in surgery, radiotherapy and chemotherapy [11–13]. The expected survival rate for patients with advanced
staged oral cancer is far lower than that of laryngeal or nasopharyngeal carcinoma, even for those patients achieving complete clinical
remission after local therapy [14]. Early detection of oral mucosal
lesions followed by appropriate treatment can increase the recovery rate to 80–90% [12]. Consequently, early diagnosis of malignant
or premalignant lesions could reduce the mortality and morbidity
associated with oral cancer.

Clinical examination and biopsy are the standard procedures to
determine the nature of oral mucosa lesions. Clinical examination
includes a thorough head, neck and intraoral visual examination and palpation of the oral cavity. Although the oral cavity is
amenable to direct examination, oral cancer is often not detected
until a late stage [14,15]. Biopsy of suspicious lesions remains
the gold standard to determine the nature of an oral lesion. The
location from which the biopsy sample is taken is crucial in
the histopathological veriﬁcation of oral cancer but selecting this
location correctly is often difﬁcult because of the non-uniform
appearance of cancerous and precancerous lesions. Biopsies are
also associated with patient discomfort. Other clinically available
techniques, such as vital tissue staining with toluidine blue and
exfoliative cell collection for cytology or molecular analysis, have
been developed to aid the early recognition of malignant lesions.
These tests have variable false-positive and false-negative rates [3].
There are currently no effective methods to screen for oral cancer. The identiﬁcation of tumor biomarkers is an essential ﬁrst
step in the development of effective early detection systems for
malignant oral lesions, especially in at-risk populations. Proteomics
is a well-established strategy for the discovery of biomarkers
for human diseases. In the case of oral cancer, saliva is a good
candidate for analysis for the identiﬁcation of biomarkers [16].
Whole saliva is composed of the secretions of the major and
minor salivary glands and gingival crevicular ﬂuid [17]. Compared
with blood sampling or biopsy, the use of saliva for oral cancer
screening is advantageous because it is easier, less invasive and
better tolerated by patients. Signiﬁcant increase of salivary soluble CD44 (solCD44) levels has been identiﬁed in head and neck
squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) patients compared with normal controls [18]. Comprehensive analysis of salivary parameters
shows that secretory immunoglobulin A, 8-oxoguanine DNA glycosylase, phosphorylated-Src and mammary serine protease inhibitor
(Maspin) are lower, while insulin growth factor I, metalloproteinases MMP-9, carbonyls and Cyclin D1 (CycD1) are higher in
OSCC patients [19,20]. Recent, proteomic analysis of saliva samples
from OSCC patients and matched healthy subjects using capillary
reversed-phase liquid chromatography with quadruple time-ofﬂight (LC-Q-TOF) mass spectrometry indicated ﬁve candidate OSCC
biomarkers (M2BP, MRP14, CD59, proﬁlin, and catalase), being successfully validated using immunoassays on an independent set of
OSCC patients and matched healthy subjects [21]. However, these
identiﬁed candidate OSCC biomarkers have no signiﬁcant relationship with tumor size, stage and recurrence.
In this study, we intended to identify salivary biomarkers of
early stage oral cancer using two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2DE) and mass spectrometry (MS). Salivary proteins which
showed potential as oral cancer biomarkers were then validated
by Western blotting and ELISA. We identiﬁed a statistically signiﬁcant correlation (P < 0.001) between salivary transferrin levels and
the oral cancer tumor grade.

2. Materials and methods
2.1. Human subjects
Unstimulated whole saliva was collected from patients with oral
squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) and OSCC-free patients at China
Medical University Hospital (Taichung, Taiwan) during 2007–2008.
Saliva collection protocols were approved by the Institutional
Review Board of China Medical University Hospital (permission
number DMR96-IRB-80), and informed consent was obtained from
each subject. OSCC patients were diagnosed via biopsy. The inclusion criteria for OSCC patients required that the subjects be 20 years
or older and immunocompetent, with a primary untreated oral

cancer. The exclusion criteria for OSCC patients included previous
chemotherapy or radiotherapy, previous oral surgery other than
oral biopsy, and the inability to properly consent. The inclusion criteria for OSCC-free control individuals required that the subjects be
20 years or older and immunocompetent. The exclusion criteria for
OSCC-free control individuals included previous chemotherapy or
irradiation, systemic conditions associated with immune dysfunction such as diabetes, the presence of any oral mucosa lesions, and
pregnancy or lactation. Five categories of subjects were included in
the analysis: OSCC-free control subjects and OSCC patients with the
tumor size (T) stages 1–4 according to the universal TNM staging
system of the International Union against Cancer (UICC) [22].
2.2. Collection of whole saliva
The OSCC patients and OSCC-free control individuals enrolled
in this study were instructed to abstain from smoking or consuming alcohol for at least 24 h before the collection of saliva.
They were instructed to brush their teeth and rinse their mouths
by gargling with clean water before they went to sleep the day
before collection. The collection procedure was always performed
early in the morning (between approximately 6 and 8 a.m.). Participants were prohibited from any food/water intake or teeth cleaning
for 1 h before salivary collection. They were instructed to gargle
and rinse their mouths with normal saline and to swallow the
ﬁrst bolus of saliva just before starting the expectoration. Whole
saliva samples were collected by subjects spitting into a collecting
cup, without mechanical or chemical stimulation. Saliva was collected for 10 min. More than 5 mL of saliva was collected from each
subject during this time. After discarding the upper frothy layer,
5 mL of saliva was collected using a syringe and placed in another
tube containing 5 ␮L CompleteTM Protease Inhibitor Cocktail, Cat.
No. 1697498 (Roche, Mannheim, Germany). The saliva samples
were kept in an ice bucket at 0 ◦ C, then centrifuged at 12,000 rpm
(∼13,400 × g) for 10 min at 4 ◦ C. The resulting supernatants were
collected, then divided in 500 ␮L aliquots and stored at −80 ◦ C.
2.3. Proteomic analysis
Both pooled OSCC and control salivary samples (100 ␮g proteins
in total each) were analyzed by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis. Salivary proteins were precipitated with acetone overnight. The
preparation was then resolved in sample rehydration buffer and
subjected to ﬁrst- and secondary-dimensional gel electrophoresis
on a Multiphor II electrophoresis apparatus (GE Healthcare, Little
Chalfont, UK) as described previously [23]. Brieﬂy, saliva samples
were prepared in lysis buffer containing 8 M urea and 4% CHAPS.
The protein concentration was measured and samples were diluted
with 350 ␮L of rehydration buffer (8 M urea, 4% CHAPS, 18 mM DTT,
0.002% bromophenol blue), and then applied to nonlinear Immobiline DryStrips (11 cm, pH 3–10; GE Healthcare, Little Chalfont, UK).
After 1-D electrophoresis on a Multiphor II system, the gel strips
were incubated for 15 min in equilibration solution I (6 M urea, 10%
SDS, 50% glycerol, 1% DTT, 0.002% bromophenol blue, 15 M Tris–HCl,
pH 8.8), and 15 min in equilibration solution II (6 M urea, 10% SDS,
50% glycerol, 2.5% iodoacetamide, 0.002% bromophenol blue, 15 M
Tris–HCl, pH 8.8). The immobilized pH gradient (IPG) gels were then
transferred to the top of 10% polyacrylamide gels (13 cm × 13 cm)
for 2-D electrophoresis. Gels were ﬁxed (30% ethanol and 10%
glacial acetic acid), and stained with silver nitrate solution, then
scanned with a GS-800 imaging densitometer and analyzed with
PDQuest software, version 7.1.1 (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA). Data
from three independently stained gels of each sample were used
for the correction of spot intensity graphs and statistical analysis
with ANOVA analysis.

2.4. In-gel digestion and MALDI-TOF/TOF MS
In-gel digestion was performed according to previously published techniques with slight modiﬁcations [23]. Brieﬂy, each
spot of interest in the silver-stained gel was excised, placed
in a microcentrifuge tube and washed twice with 50% acetonitrile (ACN) in 100 mM ammonium bicarbonate buffer (pH
8.0) for 10 min at room temperature. The excised-gel pieces
were then soaked in 100% ACN for 5 min, dried in a lyophilizer
for 15 min, rehydrated in 50 mM ammonium bicarbonate buffer
(pH 8.0) containing 20 ng mL−1 trypsin and incubated at 56 ◦ C
for 11 h. After digestion, the peptides were extracted from the
supernatant of the gel elution solution (100% ACN in 1% triﬂuoroacetic acid, TFA), and sonicated for 10 min. The proteins
were identiﬁed using MALDI-TOF/TOF MS (Bruker). The peptides were crystallized using the alpha-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic
acid (CHCA) matrix (0.1% TFA, 50% acetone, 1 mg mL−1 CHCA)
and the ﬂight time from the target to the ion detector was
calculated. Proteins were identiﬁed on the MALDI-TOF/TOF
MS spectra by searching against NCBI non-redundant protein
databases (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov) for exact matches using
the ProID program (Applied Biosystem/MDS Sciex) and the MASCOT search program (http://www.matrixscience.com). The derived
peak list generated by Mascot.dll v1.6b27 (Applied Biosystems) was
searched using a local version of the Mascot (2) search program
(v2.2.1; Matrix Science Ltd.) and the Mascot Daemon application (v2.2.0). A human (20,403 sequences) database (Swiss-Prot,
release version 57.6, 28-Jul-2009, 495,880 sequences) was used for
database searches, and a decoy protein was generated for each of
these proteins by sequence reversal to enable estimation of false
discovery rates (FDRs). The search parameters are as following:
peptide and MS/MS tolerance, ±0.3 Da; trypsin missed cleavages,
1; and variable modiﬁcations, carbamidomethylation and Met oxidation; and instrument type, MALDI-TOF/TOF. The interpretation
and presentation of MS/MS data were performed according to published guidelines [24]. The MASCOT scores greater than 55 were
signiﬁcant for PMF search (P < 0.05). In addition, individual MS/MS
spectra for peptides with a Mascot ions score lower than 40 (expect
value <0.015) were inspected manually and included in the statistics only if a series of at least four continuous y or b ions were
observed. Protein identiﬁcation was also based on the assignment
of at least two peptides. In all cases, keratins were excluded. Protein expectation value below 0.02 were initially considered true
hits with a FDR of <5.0% (estimated by the numbers of reversed
matches dividing by the total number of matches).
2.5. Western blotting and ELISA of transferrin in saliva
Salivary proteins were prepared and incubated in sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS)-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) sample
buffer (0.5 mM Tris–HCl [pH 6.8], 10% SDS, 10% glycerol, 0.5% brilliant blue R) at 95 ◦ C for 10 min. The samples were then resolved
by 10% SDS-PAGE and transferred onto polyvinylidene diﬂuoride
membranes (Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA). The membranes were
blocked with 5% skim milk in Tris buffered saline (TBS) buffer
containing 0.1% Tween 20 at 4 ◦ C for 2 h and then incubated
overnight with anti-human transferrin antibody or anti-human IgA
light chain (Abcam, Cambridge, UK) at 4 ◦ C. The membranes were
washed with TBS containing 0.1% Tween 20 and then incubated
with HRP-conjugated anti-mouse IgG antibodies (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA). The proteins of interest were visualized with the
ECLTM Western Blotting Detection Reagents (GE Healthcare) and
autoradiography (X-ray ﬁlms from Kodak, Rochester, NY, USA).
In order to validate the transferrin levels in saliva, the wells of
a 96-well microtiter plate were coated with 100 ␮L of 5 ␮g mL−1
salivary proteins and incubated at 4 ◦ C overnight. Following this

43

incubation (and each subsequent incubation step) the wells were
washed three times with TBS containing 0.05% Tween 20 (TBST).
The microtiter plate was blocked with 5% skim milk in TBST, and
then 2000× dilution of anti-human transferrin antibody was incubated in the salivary protein-coated wells for 2 h. After incubation
with 2000× dilution of goat anti-mouse IgG-HRP conjugate for 2 h,
ABTS/H2 O2 substrates were added and the optical absorbance of
the samples was recorded using an ELISA plate reader (EL X808,
BioTek, Winooski, USA).
2.6. Statistical analysis
The relationship between transferrin levels in saliva in OSCC
patients compared with OSCC-free control individuals was analyzed by the Chi-squared test with Yates’s correction or by ANOVA
analysis using SPSS software (version 10.1, SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL,
USA). Differences in mean values between the two groups were
compared using Student’s t-test. A P value of less than 0.05 was
considered statistically signiﬁcant.
3. Results
3.1. Discovery of salivary transferrin as an oral cancer biomarker
A total of 41 OSCC patients were recruited in this study, 39 (95%)
males and 2 (5%) females. The age range of OSCC patients was 29–79
with an average age of 51.2 years (Table 1). Of 30 OSCC-free control subjects, 23 (76.6%) were male and 7 (23.4%) were female.
The age range of OSCC-free control subjects was 29–66 with an
average age of 44.9 years. Although no signiﬁcant differences were
detected with respect to age or gender distribution, males were
more common in the OSCC group.
Details of the patients and their individual histopathological
diagnoses are summarized in Table 1. Among these 41 patients, 21
(51.2%) had buccal carcinomas, 19 (46.3%) had tongue carcinomas
and one patient had mouth ﬂoor cancer. Moderately differentiated keratinizing squamous cell carcinoma was the most common
histopathological appearance (28.8%). The 41 patients were classiﬁed into four categories: T1 (41.5%), T2 (36.6%), T3 (9.8%) and T4
(12.1%) according to UICC TNM staging [22].
To identify the potential salivary biomarkers for oral cancer
detection, comparison of the salivary protein proﬁles between
OSCC-free control subjects and OSCC patients was performed using
2DE analysis (Fig. 1). The intensity of each protein spot was quantiﬁed and analyzed using a GS-800 imaging densitometer and
PDQuest software. Silver-stained gels revealed 15 protein spots
with at least a 2-fold increase in spot intensity and 31 protein
spots with at least a 2-fold decrease in spot intensity in the salivary protein proﬁle of OSCC patients compared with OSCC-free
control subjects. These increased and decreased protein spots were
selected for in-gel tryptic digestion, and peptide mass ﬁngerprinting by MALDI-TOF MS. Only eleven proteins such as transferrin
(Spot ID 1) and transferrin chain A (Spot ID 7) were identiﬁed as
matching with Mascot score at greater than 55, and MW and pI of
indicated proteins in 2DE gel (Table 2). The amino acid sequence
coverage of identiﬁed up-regulatory and down-regulatory proteins
varied from 20% to 75%. For example, MALDI-TOF MS analysis of
transferrin (Spot ID 1) showed a Mascot score of 84, sequence
coverage of 56%, and 7 matched peptides (Fig. 2A), while S100
calcium-binding protein A8 (Spot ID 9) showed a Mascot score
of 94, sequence coverage of 51%, and 23 matched peptides. The
representative peptide peaks of transferrin (Spot ID 1) from MALDITOF MS analysis were further analyzed using MALDI-TOF/TOF
sequencing (Fig. 2B), resulting in a high degree of conﬁdence in
the protein identiﬁcation. To conﬁrm the protein levels of trans-

ferrin in saliva, Western blot analysis was performed on saliva
from the two groups: OSCC-free control subjects and OSCC patients
(Fig. 3). 79 kDa- and 36 kDa-immunoreactive bands for transferrin and transferrin chain A were detected in the saliva of OSCC
patients, but not in the saliva of control subjects. The result of
Western blotting was consistent with proteomic analyses of silverstained 2-DE gels as shown in Fig. 1, suggesting that transferrin
is a potential salivary biomarker for the diagnosis of oral cancer.

3.2. Correlation between the levels of salivary transferrin and the
size of oral tumors
To further investigate the potential of salivary transferrin as a
biomarker of oral cancer, ELISA analysis of salivary transferrin protein levels was performed on samples from OSCC patients with
stage T1 (n = 17), stage T2 (n = 15), stage T3 (n = 4) or stage T4 (n = 5)
pathologies and from OSCC-free individuals (n = 30). The protein
level of salivary transferrin was signiﬁcantly higher in the saliva

CI: 0.59–1.18), respectively. ELISA assay indicated that transferrinbased ELISA was highly accurate at detecting oral cancer at the T1
stage.
3.3. Correlation between plasma transferrin and oral cancer
stages
To further test the correlation between plasma transferrin concentration and different oral cancer stages, plasma samples from
OSCC patients at different stages (n = 41) and OSCC-free individuals
(n = 30) were examined by ELISA analysis. The mean plasma transferrin concentration was 256.6 mg dL−1 in the OSCC-free group,
216.3 mg dL−1 in the T1 group, 235.0 mg dL−1 in the T2 group,
and 203.6 mg dL−1 in the T3/T4 group (Fig. 6). The protein level
of plasma transferrin was lower by 16% in the T1 group, 8% in
the T2 group and 21% in the T3/T4 group compared with those in
OSCC-free individuals. However, no signiﬁcant difference of plasma
transferrin was found among T1, T2, T3/T4 and OSCC-free groups
using two-way ANOVA analysis (P = 0.3) (Fig. 6). The results indicated that the plasma transferrin levels varied in OSCC patients
and OSCC-free controls, showing no correlation with the increase
of OSCC tumor size.
4. Discussion

Fig. 1. Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis of total protein extracts from the
pooled saliva from individuals in the OSCC-free control group (A) and from patients
in the OSCC group (B). 100 ␮g of protein sample was diluted with 350 ␮L of rehydration buffer, and then applied to the nonlinear Immobiline DryStrip. After incubation
in the equilibration solutions, the IPG gels were transferred to the top of 10% polyacrylamide gels. 2-D gels were stained with silver nitrate solution. Protein size
markers (in kDa) are shown on the left of each gel. The protein spot ID numbers
are consistent with those in Table 1.

of patients suffering from oral cancer than in unaffected individuals (Fig. 4). We then assessed the relationship between the protein
level of salivary transferrin and tumor size using ANOVA analysis. Our data showed that a linear increase in salivary transferrin
levels strongly correlated with increasing tumor size (P < 0.001)
(Fig. 4). These data indicate that salivary transferrin can be used
as a biomarker for diagnosis of patients with oral cancer and can
also be used to monitor tumor growth.
In addition, receiver-operating characteristics curves (ROC)
were used to predict the sensitivity and speciﬁcity of transferrinbased ELISA for the detection of each stage of oral cancer (Fig. 5).
The threshold optical density value was set at 0.3 and the sensitivity of transferrin-based ELISA for predicting oral cancer was
100% for patients with oral cancer stage T1, 86.6% for stage T2
and 100% for stage T3/T4. The area under the receiver-operating
characteristics curves (AUROC) was used to discriminate between
OSCC-free subjects and OSCC patients displaying each stage of oral
cancer using transferrin-based ELISA (Fig. 5). AUROC for predicting
OSCC in patients was 0.95 for T1 group (95% CI: 0.48–1.05), 0.94

In this study, we compared the proteomic proﬁle of saliva from
OSCC patients with an OSCC-free control group. The results indicated that transferrin levels are elevated in the saliva of OSCC
patients (Figs. 1–3 and Table 2). A signiﬁcant increase in the protein level of salivary transferrin correlated with increasing tumor
size as represented by the UICC TNM staging system (P < 0.001)
(Fig. 4). In addition, AUROC of a saliva-based ELISA for the diagnosis
of early stage oral cancer, revealed that salivary transferrin serves
as an early stage biomarker for oral cancer (Fig. 5). Recently, parotid
acinar cells were reported to synthesize and secrete transferrin
into saliva, providing evidence that the detection of transferrin in
saliva does not indicate contamination of the sample with blood
[25]. In addition, transferrin was found to be signiﬁcantly increased
in the saliva of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC)
patients compared with unaffected controls using 2D-DIGE MS
proteomic analysis [26]. Therefore, salivary transferrin is a potential candidate as an early detection biomarker and a prognostic
marker for oral cancer, allowing for the development of diagnostic
assays.
Transferrin is essential for the growth of rapidly growing cells.
It is involved in iron-requiring metabolic processes such as DNA
synthesis, electron transport, mitogenic signaling pathways, proliferation and cell survival [27]. Over-expression of the transferrin
receptor (CD71), a type II transmembrane homodimer glycoprotein, has been reported in several cancers including lung [26,28,29],
glioma [30], colon [30,31], pancreas [32] and breast [33]. Recently,
human transferrin was demonstrated to enhance transfection efﬁciency of cationic liposome/DNA complexes into oral squamous
carcinoma cells [34,35]. Taken together, these results and the ﬁndings from this study support salivary transferrin as a potential
diagnostic marker for oral cancer.
Transferrin levels were measured in saliva from 41 OSCC
patients displaying various stages of oral cancer and 30 OSCC-free
control individuals. ELISA assay showed that the mean level of salivary transferrin in OSCC patients was higher by 91% in T1 group, 88%
in T2 group and 84% in T3/T4 group compared with those in control
group (Fig. 4). By contrast, the level of plasma transferrin decreased
in OSCC patients, but did not signiﬁcantly associate with OSCC onset
or tumor stage (Fig. 6), implying that increase of salivary trans-

ferrin levels did not result from the leakage of plasma transferrin
in OSCC patients. Moreover, the speciﬁcity and sensitivity of salivary transferrin-based ELISA was 100% and 100% in T1 group, and
100% and 95% in overall OSCC patients, respectively. By contrast,
the sensitivity of salivary solCD44 levels for detection of HNSCC
patients ranged from 62% to 70%, and its speciﬁcity ranged from
75% to 88% [18]. The sensitivity and speciﬁcity values of CycD1 and
Maspin as candidate OSCC markers were 100% [20]. In addition, the
combination of M2BP, MRP14, CD59, proﬁlin, and catalase as candidate biomarkers yielded a receiver-operating characteristic value
of 93%, sensitivity of 90%, and speciﬁcity of 83% in detecting OSCC
[21]. Comparison of salivary transferrin with these reported candidate markers indicated that the receiver-operating characteristic
value, speciﬁcity and sensitivity salivary transferrin were similar
to those of reported candidate OSCC markers. Of candidate mark-

ers, only salivary transferrin showed the ability for the detection of
early stage oral cancer. In the OSCC-free control group, four samples
exhibiting elevated levels of salivary transferrin were from individuals suffering from right parotid mixed tumor, alcoholic liver
cirrhosis, nasal polyposis or bronchial asthma. Increased levels of
serum transferrin have previously been reported in patients with
alcoholic liver disease and asthma [36,37]. Therefore, the combination of salivary transferrin and other OSCC markers could rule out
the false positive and conﬁrm the early diagnosis of OSCC.
Comparison of silver-stained 2DE gels indicated increased levels
of zinc ﬁnger protein 497, Ig heavy chain variable region and S100
calcium-binding protein A8, and the decreased levels of Kappa B-ras
1, annexin A2, Ig alpha-2 chain, and IgA1-Fc chain A in saliva of OSCC
patients (Fig. 1 and Table 2). S100 calcium-binding protein A8 has
been reported to up-regulate in prostatic intraepithelial neopla-

sia and preferentially in high-grade adenocarcinomas, serving as a
novel diagnostic marker in human prostate cancer [38]. In addition,
S100 calcium-binding proteins S100A12 and S100P were identiﬁed
as up-regulated proteins in saliva of OSCC patients using LC-Q-TOF
[21]. Therefore, the role of S100 proteins in OSCC diagnosis needs
for further investigation.
In conclusion, we performed proteomic analysis of saliva from
OSCC patients and OSCC-free control subjects, and identiﬁed transferrin as a potential salivary biomarker for the diagnosis of early
stage oral cancer in humans. Our ﬁndings were conﬁrmed by
MALDI-TOF/TOF mass spectra and Western blotting. In addition,
salivary transferrin levels strongly correlated with tumor size. ROC
demonstrated the high speciﬁcity and sensitivity of a transferrinbased ELISA for predicting oral cancer. The AUROC indicated that
the transferrin-based ELISA has high accuracy at detecting early
stage oral cancer. Future studies will examine the potential application of salivary transferrin as a screening tool for early stage oral
cancer.
