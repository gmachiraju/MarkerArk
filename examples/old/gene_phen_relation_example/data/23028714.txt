Investigating Embryonic Expression Patterns and Evolution of _AHI1_ and _CEP290_ Genes, Implicated in Joubert Syndrome
Joubert syndrome and related diseases (JSRD) are developmental cerebello-oculo-renal syndromes with phenotypes including cerebellar hypoplasia, retinal dystrophy and nephronophthisis (a cystic kidney disease). We have utilised the MRC-Wellcome Trust Human Developmental Biology Resource (HDBR), to perform in-situ hybridisation studies on embryonic tissues, revealing an early onset neuronal, retinal and renal expression pattern for _AHI1._ An almost identical pattern of expression is seen with _CEP290_ in human embryonic and fetal tissue. A novel finding is that both _AHI1_ and _CEP290_ demonstrate strong expression within the developing choroid plexus, a ciliated structure important for central nervous system development. To test if _AHI1_ and _CEP290_ may have co-evolved, we carried out a genomic survey of a large group of organisms across eukaryotic evolution. We found that, in animals, _ahi1_ and _cep290_ are almost always found together; however in other organisms either one may be found independent of the other. Finally, we tested in murine epithelial cells if Ahi1 was required for recruitment of Cep290 to the centrosome. We found no obvious differences in Cep290 localisation in the presence or absence of Ahi1, suggesting that, while Ahi1 and Cep290 may function together in the whole organism, they are not interdependent for localisation within a single cell. Taken together these data support a role for _AHI1_ and _CEP290_ in multiple organs throughout development and we suggest that this accounts for the wide phenotypic spectrum of _AHI1_ and _CEP290_ mutations in man. 
Joubert syndrome and related diseases (JSRD) are a group of inherited ciliopathies, characterised by a cerebello-retinal-renal phenotype. The brain phenotype is a developmental midbrain malformation leading to cerebellar vermis hypoplasia or aplasia, and seen in brain MRI imaging as a molar tooth sign. Other structural brain defects including hypoplasia of the corpus callosum and occipital meningoencephalocele have been reported. Retinal dysplasia and degeneration occur in a proportion of patients and may lead to progressive blindness. Ocular coloboma may also be a feature. Renal disease is variable, with nephronophthisis and multicystic dysplasia as reported phenotypes, which may lead to end stage renal failure. Consistent with JSRD as a ciliopathy are the findings of polydactaly and liver fibrosis. In keeping with the clinical heterogeneity of JSRD, 16 causal genes, have been identified in patients. These include _INPP5E_, _TMEM216_9, _AHI1_,,, _NPHP1_, _NPHP6_ (_CEP290_), _TMEM67_, _RPGRIP1L_, _ARL13B_, _CC2D2A_, _CXORF5_, _TTC21B_, _KIF7_, _TCTN1_, _TMEM237_, _CEP41_ and _TMEM138_. Defects in these genes produce phenotypes that may be termed ciliopathies, given that the protein products encoded by all of these genes have been localised in the basal body, centrosome or primary cilium, a highly conserved cellular organelle, central to the regulation of cellular signalling pathways. Mutations in _AHI1_ and _CEP290_ are both a frequent causes of Joubert syndrome and genetic variants in both genes may act as modifier alleles, especially in regard to a retinal and CNS phenotype. Mutations in _AHI1_ (Abelson-helper integration site-1) are the most common genetic cause of JSRD, accounting for 12% of cases and 20% of individuals with Joubert syndrome and Leber's congenital amaurosis. _AHI1_ is highly conserved throughout evolution and encodes the Ahi1 protein (also known as Jouberin). We have previously demonstrated that Ahi1 localises to centrosomes/basal bodies of renal epithelial cells, and that it interacts with the nephrocystin-1 protein. At a genomic level, there is evidence for _AHI1_ mutations/polymorphisms having an oligogenic effect and modulating the phenotype. For example Tory _et al_. describe 5 patients with homozygous _NPHP1_ mutations together with a R830W mutation in _AHI1_, which leads to a more severe central nervous system defect. Similarly, the relative risk (RR) of a retinal defect associated with nephronophthisis was significantly increased (RR=7.5 (95% CI 4.011.2)) in the presence of the R830W _AHI1_ mutation. Mutations in _CEP290_ may cause a wide spectrum of human disease ranging from isolated Leber's congenital amaurosis to JSRD, Meckel syndrome (MKS) and Bardet-Biedl syndrome (BBS). Renal disease is common in patients with _CEP290_ mutations, and may be secondary to NPHP and renal cortical cysts. _CEP290_ mutations account for around 50% of cases of JSRD with renal and retinal disease. Some additional phenotypes in patients with _CEP290_ mutations have included occipital encephaloceles and septal heart defects. _CEP290_ mutations are a common cause of isolated Leber's congenital amaurosis, accounting for 20% of patients. _CEP290_ is highly conserved throughout evolution and encodes the Cep290 protein (also known as nephrocystin-6). We have previously demonstrated that Cep290 localises to centrosomes/basal bodies of renal epithelial cells and that it interacts with ATF4. Additional _CEP290_/Cep290 interactions include a genetic interaction with _CC2D2A_ and protein complex interactions with CP110 and Rab8a. In a similar manner to patients with _NPHP1_ mutations, there is some evidence that alleles of _AHI1_ may also modify the neurological phenotype of patients with _CEP290_ mutations. Given this evidence implicating an important role for _CEP290_ and _AHI1_ in modulating brain, eye and other phenotypes in JSRD, we sought to identify the pattern of both _AHI1_ and _CEP290_ expression in kidney and central nervous system during development. Using human embryonic and fetal tissue we describe the expression pattern of _AHI1_ and _CEP290_ during stages of human renal and brain development. To determine whether _AHI1_ and _CEP290_ may have co-evolved, we performed a genomic survey of a large group of organisms across eukaryotic evolution. We also explored whether Ahi1 was required for recruitment of Cep290 to the centrosome. Our novel data emphasises the important and extensive role of _AHI1_ and _CEP290_ in vertebrate development, from essential cellular signalling organelles, such as the primary cilium, to complex organ systems such as the brain and kidney. This study was conducted with full ethical approval. For human embryonic and fetal tissue samples, the samples were collected with appropriate maternal consents and ethical approval by the Newcastle and North Tyneside 1 Research Ethics Committee, UK. Human embryonic and fetal tissues were obtained from the MRC/Wellcome Trust-funded Human Developmental Biology Resource (;. In situ hybridisation was performed on human embryo paraffin sections as previously described with some modifications. Briefly, sections were dewaxed in xylene, gradually hydrated in decreasing ethanol concentrations before incubation in Proteinase K (20 g/ml) at room temperature (RT), followed by fixation in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS. Background was reduced by treating with 0.1 M Triethanolamine pH 8. Sections were air dried and probe added (300 ng labeled probe per 100 ul of Dig Easy Hyb mix (Roche)) at 68C overnight. The next day sections were washed once in 5 SSC then once in 2 SSC at 60C then incubated with anti-digoxigenin AP Fab fragments (Roche) diluted 11000 at 4C overnight. Sections were then washed and expression detected using NBT/BCIP (20 ul/ml Roche) in 0.1 M Tris/0.1 M NaCl (pH 9.5) in the dark at room temperature. Developing was stopped by rinsing slides first in 0.1 M Tris/0.1 M NaCl (pH 9.5) then in deionised H2O. Sections were mounted using Aquamount. Samples from Carnegie stage (CS) 12 (26 days post conception (dpc)) to 9 weeks post conception (PCW) were used (CS12 (N548); CS14 (N663, N7120); CS15 (N734); CS16 (N218); CS17 (N1247); CS19 (N470); CS20 (N590); CS22 (N225, N2188); CS23 (N300); 9 PCW (N477, N9223)). Sections from 13 different embryos/fetuses were used in total. _In situ_ hybridisation probes for human expression studies of _AHI1_ were generated using PCR and subcloning into pGEMTeasy vectors. All clones were sequenced to confirm orientation with respect to T7 and SP6 promoters. Both sense and antisense RNA probes were produced by _in vitro_ transcription from the T7 and SP6 RNA polymerase sites respectively of the pGEM-T Easy vector. Probes were generated from two regions of the _AHI1_ gene (BC094800), nucleotides 1 to 276 (in 5UTR) and nucleotides 2105 to 2635 (in 3UTR) using the Riboprobe system (Promega). Both probe sets gave similar patterns however the 5UTR probe set gave a higher background in preliminary experiments (data not shown). The 3UTR probe set was used for all the experiments reported here. _In situ_ hybridisation probes for human expression studies of _CEP290_ were generated from two regions of _CEP290_ (NM_025114) using the Riboprobe system (Promega) as above: nucleotides 675 to 1381 and 6265 to 6924 (both in the coding sequence). Although a similar pattern was detected with both antisense probes, there was a higher background with the 675 to 1381 nucleotide sense probe (data not shown). The 6265 to 6924 nucleotide probe set was used for all the experiments reported here. Antisense probes for sonic hedgehog (_SHH_, NM_000193) were used as a positive control. The _SHH_ probe, which contains nucleotides from 460 to 950, showed the expected specific staining in the spinal cord and notochord (data not shown). Antisense RNA probe of developing brain homeobox 1 (_DBX1_, NM_001029865) transcribed from nucleotides 308 to 830 which shows specific staining at the sulcus limitans of spinal cord was also used as an experimental control (data not shown). Expression patterns were analysed using the Axioplan 2 imaging system (Zeiss). Putative Ahi1 and Cep290 orthologues were identified using a combination of reciprocal best BLASTP and PSI-BLAST, with human Ahi1 (isoform a, NP_001128302.1) and Cep290 (NP_079390.3) as the query sequences. The initial Ahi1 search generated a very large number of false positives, which were only similar in terms of WD40 repeats. To overcome this problem, we performed further searches using human Ahi1 amino acids 1545. These protein sequences were used to query the non-redundant predicted proteomes of 44 organisms (33 flagellate, 11 non-flagellate) chosen to represent a wide evolutionary spread of eukaryotes. Searches were carried out using the NCBI stand-alone BLAST+ application (version 2.2.25+, ) against BLAST-formatted genomes from a variety of sources (see. We used the following criteria to define a putative Ahi1 or Cep290 orthologue: 1) An e-value less than 1e-05 (BLASTp) or 1e-10 (PSI-BLAST), 2) A reciprocal BLAST which returns the original sequence, and 3) Manual examination of sequences and alignments constructed using MAFFT. Mouse inner medullary collecting duct (IMCD-3) cells were cultured in DMEM/Ham's F12 supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (SigmaAldrich Co. Ltd., Poole, UK). For functional analyses, passage 1617 IMCD3 cells were cultured on 13 mm glass coverslips. Cells were transfected with a pool containing 100 pmol of each of four siRNA duplexes (OnTargetPlus SMARTpool, Dharmacon) against mouse Ahi1 at 6070% confluency using Lipofectamine 2000 according to our previously established methods. The medium GC non-targeting control (Invitrogen) was used as a negative control. siRNAs were as follows: oligo 1 5-GGUCAAAAGACGAUCGCUA-3, oligo 2 5-UGAAGUUAGCCGCCGUGUAA-3, oligo 3 5-GCUAAAUGUCGUCGAGGUU-3, oligo 4 5-GUGAAACACUGUAUCGAGA-3. As a further control, siRNA studies were repeated with two individual siRNA oligonucleotides (numbers 2 and 3, above, data not shown). We have previously characterised these duplexes in this same cell line and demonstrated successful siRNA knockdown. Transfected cells were identified using co-transfection with siGLO red (Dharmacon). Transfection efficiency was estimated at 7580%. Immunofluorescence was carried out 72 hours after transfection using anti-Cep290 (Abcam, ab84870) and anti-gamma tubulin (clone GTU-88, Sigma Aldrich) followed by goat anti-mouse AlexaFluor 488 and 647 (Molecular Probes). Samples were visualised using a Zeiss LSM510 confocal microscope controlled by LSM examiner software (Carl Zeiss). Images were processed in ImageJ to produce maximum intensity projections. There has been no previous documentation of _AHI1_ spatial expression during development in human tissue. Previous characterisation has been limited to hybridisation to RNA northern blot showing expression in fetal brain, kidney, liver and lung, and Western blotting, demonstrating Ahi1 protein expression in fetal cerebellum and spinal cord. Using specific probes targeted towards nucleotides 2105 to 2635 of _AHI1_ mRNA we observed a strong and specific pattern of expression in the brain and spinal cord from CS16 to CS23 (; see also for developmental overview). _AHI1_ expression was abundant in the developing telencephalon (), especially the neuroepithelium, and in the neural retina ( respectively). Strikingly, we observed expression within the choroid plexus. Prominent expression was also seen in the mesencephalon and throughout the developing hindbrain (metencephalon and myelencephalon, ) including the rhombic lip of the developing cerebellum. There was particularly prominent staining within the alar plate of the spinal cord as well as in the spinal and other ganglia of the peripheral nervous system. _SHH_ and _DBX1_ antisense probes were used as positive controls and the expected patterns of expression were seen in the developing spinal cord (data not shown). _AHI1_ expression during human nephrogenesis was examined from stages CS14 through to 9 PCW. These studies revealed that _AHI1_ transcripts are abundant in both the developing mesonephros and metanephros. Extra renal sites of expression included prominent staining of the embryonic liver and embryonic gonad. Detailed studies through mesonephric development showed discrete _AHI1_ expression in the mesonephric excretory unit at CS12 (data not shown) and CS14CS22. By CS23, _AHI1_ expression was visible in degenerating glomeruli of the mesonephros and at 9 PCW, expression was detectable in the mesonephric tubule, ducts and paramesonephric duct, structures that will form parts of the future reproductive system ( respectively). _AHI1_ expression was seen in early (permanent) metanephric kidney () with intense staining in the metanephric cap and ureteric bud at CS14 and CS16. By CS22 and later, developing glomeruli, tubules and collecting ducts strongly expressed _AHI1_. More detailed analysis of _AHI1_ expression at 9 PCW revealed intense staining in both tubular epithelium and glomerular structures. Expression was seen in cortical and medullary epithelium, including the epithelium lining of the renal calyces. Glomerular staining was intense in a subset of cells whilst there was an absence of expression in the renal interstitium, indicating low levels of _AHI1_ transcript in interstitial cells and vascular endothelium. Thus, in human tissue _AHI1_ is strongly expressed in all developing renal tissues from the mesonephros to the precursors of the adult kidney, with a broad expression throughout the nephron and collecting ducts during renal development. The _CEP290_ spatial expression during development in human tissue has not previously been reported. Previous characterisation has been limited to hybridisation to RNA northern blot of adult tissues showing expression of a major _CEP290_ transcript of approximately 8 kb that is expressed strongly in placenta and weakly in adult brain. Using specific probes targeted towards nucleotides 6265 to 6924 of _CEP290_ mRNA we observed a strong and specific pattern of expression in the brain and spinal cord from CS16 to CS22. _CEP290_ expression was seen in the developing telencephalon (), especially the neuroepithelium, and in the neural retina ( respectively). Prominent expression was seen in the choroid plexus () and throughout the developing hindbrain. Expression of _CEP290_ is also seen in the rhombic lip of the developing cerebellum () and the mesencephalic and cerebellar neuroepithelium. In the spinal cord there was particularly prominent staining within the alar plate and some staining of the spinal and sympathetic ganglia. This expression pattern seen in the developing human brain with _CEP290_ mirrors the pattern seen for _AHI1_ (compare with. _CEP290_ expression during human nephrogenesis was examined from CS12 through to 9 PCW. _CEP290_ transcripts are abundant in both the developing mesonephros and metanephros. Specific areas of _CEP290_ expression are seen in the mesonephric excretory unit at CS12CS23. By 9 PCW, _CEP290_ expression was seen in early (permanent) metanephric kidney with intense staining in the developing glomeruli, tubules and collecting ducts. Thus, like _AHI1, CEP290_ is strongly expressed in the mesonephros and metanephros precursors of the adult kidney. Similar to _AHI1_, expression of CEP290 was low/absent in the renal interstitium. This great similarity of expression in humans prompted us to ask if _AHI1_ and _CEP290_ might have co-evolved. We have previously shown using a reciprocal BLASTp approach that _AHI1_ is highly evolutionarily conserved, and is restricted to the genomes of ciliated organisms. Given the strong overlap in expression between _AHI1_ and _CEP290_, we extended this analysis using PSI-BLAST and reciprocal BLASTp to identify additional homologues. We searched the predicted proteomes of 44 eukaryotic organisms chosen to represent a wide evolutionary spread of organisms, both ciliated (33 organisms) and non-ciliated (11 organisms). Both _ahi1_ and _cep290_ evolved prior to the evolution of multicellularity, are conserved from ciliated protozoa to man, and are restricted to the genomes of organisms that build cilia or flagella. Putative orthologues of both _AHI1_ and _CEP290_ were present in the genomes of organisms that build only sensory cilia (_Daphnia_, _Tribolium_) as well as in the genomes of organisms that build either motile cilia/flagella only, or both motile and sensory cilia, implying that both _ahi1_ and _cep290_ are required for basal body/cilium function in cells with motile cilia and cells with sensory cilia. Building on our previous observation that _ahi1_ was only present in the genomes of organisms that build a canonical nine-triplet centriole, both _ahi1_ and _cep290_ were absent from the genome of _Toxoplasma gondii_ and the two nematode genomes in our study, which all build specialised, non-canonical centrioles. Therefore, _ahi1_ and _cep290_ may both be required for triplet centriole function. In animals, _ahi1_ and _cep290_ were both found in all organisms except in Dipthera (_Anopheles_ and _Drosophila_) and _Gallus_, indicating a possible common function in metazoa that is consistent with the expression data. However, while there was a general trend for _ahi1_ and _cep290_ to both be present in a given genome, this was not invariable. We found only a predicted _AHI1_ orthologue in 5 genomes (_Aureococcus anophagefferens, Naegleria gruberi,, Trichomonas vaginalis, Trypanosoma brucei_) and only a predicted _CEP290_ orthologue in a further 5 genomes (_Anopheles gambiae, Drosophila melanogaster, Micromonas pulsilla, Monosiga brevicollis, Gallus gallus_) suggesting that, while _ahi1_ and _cep290_ might function together in animals, they are not co-dependent in all organisms. Cep290 is a 290 kDa protein that is localised at the centrosome. To examine whether Ahi1 is necessary for correct recruitment of Cep290 to centrosomes,, we ablated _Ahi1_ expression using siRNA in IMCD3 renal epithelial cells and visualised Cep290 and centrosomes using anti-Cep290 and anti-gamma tubulin immunofluorescence. We examined the appearance of the Cep290 signal at centrosomes throughout the cell. There was no difference in the distribution of centrosomes between _Ahi1_-silenced cells and controls (), indicating that the centrosome is still able to re-orient to the apical cell surface in the absence of Ahi1. We found no obvious differences in the immunofluorescence pattern between control and _Ahi1_ siRNA-treated cells (), regardless of the centrosome position within the cell, indicating that Ahi1 and Cep290 are not interdependent for localisation to centrosomes. We have demonstrated early embryonic expression of _AHI1_ and _CEP290_ in human embryonic tissues, with a remarkable similarity in expression patterns. Both _AHI1_ and CEP290 are widely expressed in multiple tissues, including developing brain, eye, spinal cord and renal tissues. Previous expression studies in murine tissues showed _Ahi1_ expression in neurons of the developing hindbrain/midbrain/forebrain, pituitary, testis and kidney. _Ahi1_ expression in murine brain was reported during early embryonic life (day 10.5) and persisted into adult life. Interestingly, in Doering's studies, mouse Ahi1 protein expression was not seen in the developing or mature cerebellum although AHI1 was present in the human cerebellum, suggesting a species difference. Indeed, these studies commented that the highest AHI1 expression in adult brain tissue was in the cerebellar vermis and cerebellar peduncles. A functional role for _AHI1_ in brain development is suggested by the numerous structural defects associated with Joubert syndrome. We were able to demonstrate prominent _AHI1_ expression in the developing retina. It is now well established that the light sensitive photoreceptor cells of the retina are specialised sensory cilia. Inherited forms of retinal degeneration, where these cells are affected are now a hallmark of diseases termed ciliopathies. Numerous gene defects, encoding proteins expressed in cilia, may be associated with retinal degeneration. _NPHP5_ mutations are a prominent cause of retinal degeneration. _Ahi1/_ mutant mice fail to develop photoreceptor outer segments, leading to retinal degeneration. Ahi1 was seen to be expressed at the transition zone of photoreceptor cells of wild-type mice, colocalising with the transition zone marker Rpgrip1. The _Ahi1/_ murine model mimics closely the defect seen in JSRD patients with _AHI1_ mutations. Our data of human _AHI1_ expression in retinal development confirms this requirement of AHI1 for normal photoreceptor development. Consistent with the renal phenotype seen in some JSRD patients, we demonstrate for the first time _AHI1_ and _CEP290_ expression in the human embryonic kidney. Indeed, murine data showing detailed kidney expression of these genes is also lacking. The pattern of expression during development of the mesonephros and metanephros points to a role in tubulogenesis, epithelial cell polarity and maintenance of orientated cell division, as has been described for other ciliary proteins. In human adult kidney, we have previously demonstrated that Ahi1 protein expression is limited to the distal tubule and collecting duct nephron segments, whilst murine kidney tissue from a 5 month week old animal revealed _Ahi1_ expression at the corticomedullary junction. A postnatal increase in Ahi1 protein expression has also been described. This suggests that renal Ahi1 expression must be regulated throughout development and into adult life, and that a role for maintenance of distal tubular function continues into adult life. There have been no previous studies documenting the renal expression of _CEP290_ in human kidney. Previous studies have documented expression of murine _Cep290,_ with RNA blot analysis revealing expression at embryonic day 7 to E17 in whole embryos, and kidney and brain expression at P0.. _In situ_ hybridisation studies in murine cerebellum have demonstrated expression in the external (proliferative) and internal granule layer in the midline at E18 and the latter expression persists into adulthood. At the earlier human stages studied here, _CEP290_ expression is detected in cerebellar neuroepithelium, also a proliferative layer, as well as mesencephalic and telencephalic neuroepithelium. The Cep290 protein has also been localized within photoreceptor cells, to the connecting cilium adjoining the outer segment to the photoreceptor cell body. _CEP290_ mutations are the commonest monogenic form of Leber's congenital amaurosis (LCA). A murine model of _Cep290_ deficiency reveals early post-natal photoreceptor degeneration whilst human studies in patients with _CEP290_ mutations suggest that whilst there is initial development of rod photoreceptors during early development, the distal segments of photoreceptors are structurally abnormal after maturation, causing early and severe loss of visual function typically within the first decade of life. The retinal expression of _CEP290_ we have shown during early development in humans is consistent with a role for _CEP290_ in photoreceptor cell development. The expression of both _AHI1_ and _CEP290_ in the choroid plexus is a novel and interesting finding. The choroid plexus produces cerebrospinal fluid and is circulated through the ventricles of the brain and the subarachnoid space. The ependymal cells lining the ventricular space are known to possess motile cilia, and that defects in these motile cilia can contribute to an obstruction of CSF flow leading to hydrocephalus. In contrast, the murine ciliopathy model _Tg737orpk_ demonstrated hydrocephalus before formation of motile cilia in the ependymal cells, implicating defects in choroid plexus function (such as increased CSF production) as a primary event in these animals. Primary cilia are intimately related to the regulation of CSF production. Indeed clusters of primary cilia on choroid plexus epithelia cells have been shown to act as chemosensors to regulate CSF production. Upon _ahi1_ knockdown in zebrafish, we have previously shown hydrocephalus, alongside other defects associated with a ciliopathy. A similar appearance, with prominent hydrocephalus was seen with cep290 (alias _nphp6_) knockdown in zebrafish. To date, murine models of _Ahi1_ and _Cep290_ knockdown have not demonstrated gross hydrocephalus. The brain defect that these mice have revealed includes cerebellar hypoplasia with a vermis/midline fusion defect early in development. In humans with JSRD, hydrocephalus is a rarer finding, however recently mutations in the _CC2D2A_ gene (whose protein product interacts with CEP290 ) have been associated with ventriculomegaly and hydrocephalus. Our experiments suggest that a functional role for _AHI1_ and _CEP290_ is likely within the developing brain, including the choroid plexus. A proteomics and interaction mapping project has recently been published which details a number of important interactions for both Ahi1 and Cep290. Mks1, Mks6, and Tectonic1 bind to Ahi1 protein, which also co-purified with inversin, whilst Cep290 bound strongly with nephrocystin-5. Depletion of nephrocystin-5 had no effect on Cep290 localization, whilst nephrocystin-5 failed to localize to the centrosome in the absence of Cep290. The studies defined 3 protein connecting modules where nephrocystin proteins 1, 4 and 8 function together at the apical surface of the cell, nephrocystin-5 and -6 function at the centrosome and the MKS group of proteins (Mks1, Mks6 and Tctn2) function in a hedgehog signalling pathway. Ahi1 was seen as a linking protein between MKS and centrosomal modules. In an attempt to determine whether Ahi1 is necessary for correct recruitment of Cep290 to the area around centrosomes, we found no loss of localisation, which is consistent with Sang's recently published localisation data set. In conclusion, we have demonstrated in human development an expression pattern for _AHI1_ and _CEP290_ which includes neuronal, retinal and renal structures. _AHI1_ and _CEP290_ are highly conserved throughout evolution, but can be expressed and function independently.
