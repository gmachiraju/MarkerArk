Mutations of the _SLX4_ gene in Fanconi anemia
Fanconi anemia (FA) is a rare recessive disorder characterized by genome instability, congenital malformations, progressive bone marrow failure, and predisposition to hematologic malignancies and solid tumors. At the cellular level, hypersensitivity to DNA interstrand crosslinks (ICLs) is the defining feature in FA. Mutations in thirteen distinct FA genes have been shown to interfere with the DNA-replication dependent repair of lesions involving crosslinked DNA at stalled replication forks. Depletion of SLX4, which interacts with multiple nucleases and has been recently identified as a Holliday junction resolvase, results in increased sensitivity of the cells to DNA crosslinking agents. Here we report the identification of biallelic _SLX4_ mutations in two patients with typical clinical features of FA and show that the cellular defects in the patients cells are complemented by wild-type SLX4, demonstrating that biallelic mutations in _SLX4/FANCP_ cause a new subtype of Fanconi anemia, FA-P. SLX4 is a multidomain scaffold protein interacting with three distinct nucleases SLX1, ERCC4/XPF-ERCC1, and MUS81-EME1. While the SLX4-SLX1 interaction is largely responsible for the Holliday junction resolvase activity seen in the complex, SLX4 can also stimulate the activity of ERCC4/XPF and MUS81 nucleases, both of which have been previously implicated in the processing of interstrand crosslinks (ICLs). The finding that depletion of SLX4 leads to increased sensitivity to cross-linking agents and camptothecin prompted us to investigate SLX4 as a candidate gene for Fanconi anemia. So far, mutations in thirteen genes are responsible for FA. Eight of the FA proteins (FANCA/B/C/E/F/G/L/M) form a core complex, a nuclear E3 ubiquitin ligase which ubiquitinates FANCI and FANCD2,. These two activated proteins subsequently localize as an FANC_I_/FANC_D_2 (ID) complex to chromatin and direct repair in part through interaction with the newly identified nuclease FAN1. Cells with mutations in the FA core complex (except for FANCM) lack monoubiquitination of FANCD2. The other FA proteins are FANCJ/BRIP1, a helicase, and homologous recombination (HR) effectors, FANCN/PALB2 and FANCD1/BRCA2. Recently, RAD51C, also involved in HR repair, has been found to be mutated in three patients with an FA-like disorder. Cells mutated in _FANCJ/N/D1_ and _RAD51C_ have normal FANCD2 monoubiquitination and these genes are thought to work downstream of the ID complex. As depletion of SLX4 in a U2OS cell line does not affect FANCD2 ubiquitination (), we sequenced _SLX4_ in the families from the International Fanconi Anemia Registry with unassigned FA complementation groups and normal FANCD2 modification () and identified two families carrying germline mutations, IFAR1084 and IFAR414. Phenotypes of the two patients are summarized in. The lymphoblastoid cell line (LCL) (RA3042) and fibroblasts (RA3083) from the patient 1084/1 showed increased genomic instability ( and ) and increased sensitivity to Mitomycin C (MMC). The 414/1 patients LCL (RA 1376) was not sensitive to MMC suggestive of reversion (); however, his skin fibroblasts (RA 3331) displayed a high degree of DEB induced chromosomal instability ( and ) and sensitivity to MMC. No UV sensitivity was observed in fibroblasts from either of the patients. Fibroblasts from the patient 414/1 (RA3331), but interestingly not patient 1084/1 (RA3083), were sensitive to camptothecin (CPT), a topoisomerase I inhibitor. Sequencing of the cDNA from the 1084/1 patients cells revealed skipping of Exon 5 (), due to a homozygous point mutation in the canonical splice donor dinucleotide GT in intron 5 (c.1163+2T>A) in the genomic DNA. Both parents were found to be heterozygous and an unaffected sibling was found to be negative for this mutation. The predicted effect of this mutation is a 70 amino acid deletion of amino acids (aa) 317 to 387 of SLX4 (p.R317_F387del), leading to an in-frame deletion of the conserved Cys and Leu of the first UBZ domain and the whole second UBZ domain. Immunoprecipitation of SLX4 from the cell line RA3083 confirmed the presence of a slightly shorter protein product (, lane 5,. In patient 414/1, a heterozygous frameshift mutation in exon 2 (c.514delC) was detected by sequencing of the full length RT-PCR product () and confirmed in the genomic DNA of the patient and his father. The predicted protein effect of this frame-shift mutation is a truncated protein with N-terminal 171aa of SLX4 followed by 22 non-SLX4 aa (p.L172FfsX22). The second allele of SLX4 in the second patient, identified as described in Online Methods, showed a large genomic deletion from intron 9 to exon 12 resulting in c.2013+225_3147delinsCC. The predicted effect of this mutation is a truncated protein with N-terminal 671aa of SLX4 followed by 119 non-SLX4 aa due to a frameshift (p.L672VfsX119). Consequently, immunoprecipitation with the antibody against SLX4 failed to identify the full-length protein in the patients fibroblasts RA3331 (, lane 6). To prove that the mutations identified in _SLX4_ were causal for the FA phenotype of both patients, we introduced the WT or the mutant _SLX4_ cDNAs into the patients fibroblasts (RA3083 and RA3331) and performed functional complementation assays ( and. Expression of WT SLX4 in both cell lines almost fully rescued the MMC sensitivity (, ), the late S/G2 arrest with MMC treatment (, ), and the chromosomal instability after treatment with DEB. Some residual MMC sensitivity, cell cycle arrest, and chromosomal breakage is most likely due to some cells losing expression of the SLX4 as evident by immunofluorescence analysis (data not shown). Introduction of the mutant proteins did not rescue the FA phenotypes of the patients cells although a slight improvement was noted in the various assays possibly due to overexpression of the mutant proteins, which might have residual function. These experiments demonstrate that biallelic _SLX4_ mutations cause a new subtype of Fanconi anemia, FA-P and _FANCP_ becomes an alias for the _SLX4_ gene. SLX4 interacts with multiple factors, two of which, ERCC4/XPF and MUS81 have been previously implicated in crosslink repair. We therefore tested whether the mutant SLX4 proteins from both patients still interacted with the ERCC4/XPF and MUS81 complexes. We found that ERCC4/XPF, MUS81, and ERCC1 co-immunoprecipitate with endogenous mutant SLX4 (p.R317_F387del) from RA3083 fibroblasts (, lane 5 and, lane 4), although the levels of the mutant SLX4 protein were consistently lower in multiple experiments leading to diminished immunoprecipitation of the interacting factors. The second patients SLX4 p.L672VfsX119 overexpressed in RA3331 fibroblasts showed diminished but present interaction with ERCC4/XPF and ERCC1, but not with MUS81 (, lane 3). This was consistent with the previous findings that MUS81 interacts with aa 6841834 fragment of the SLX4 protein which are deleted in the p.L672VfsX119 mutant protein. Immunoprecipitation with an antibody recognizing the N terminus of SLX4 from RA3331 cells showed greatly diminished interaction with ERCC4/XPF, ERCC1, and MUS81 (, lane 6). As UBZ domains are known to interact with ubiquitin, we hypothesized that the absence of the tandem UBZ domains in the mutant SLX4 from patient 1084/1 might disrupt the binding of the SLX4 complex to ubiquitin chains of repair proteins at the sites of DNA damage, as shown for the tandem UBZ domains of RAP80. We therefore performed _in vitro_ ubiquitin binding assays () that showed binding of the isolated UBZ domains of SLX4 to the K63 chains of ubiquitin (, lane 8). When the two conserved cysteines from each UBZ domain were mutated to alanines () the binding was reduced to background levels seen with GST alone (, compare lane 7 and 9), suggesting the possibility that SLX4 may localize to the sites of damage through binding to K63 ubiquitinated substrates. As SLX4 would localize other proteins including ERCC4/XPF, MUS81 and SLX1 to sites of DNA damage, the SLX4 deficient patient cell lines described here are important tools to understand which interactions of SLX4 are essential for the repair of cross-linked DNA and ultimately to define the importance of the SLX4/FANCP function in the FA pathway. Patient phenotypes also provide an important clue. FA patients with mutations in _FANCN/PALB2_ or _FANCD1/BRCA2_ genes, which are essential for homologous recombination, have very early onset of childhood solid tumors and AML,. FA patients with _SLX4/FANCP_ mutations show a milder phenotype more akin to that seen in FA patients with mutations in the FA core or the ID complex components. This suggests that the Holliday junction resolution, an integral step of homologous recombination, might not be the essential function of SLX4 in the somatic compartment during crosslink repair and that the repair depends on the other nucleases, ERCC4/XPF and MUS81 that interact with SLX4. SLX4/FANCP represents a second protein (besides FANCM) that is conserved in lower eukaryotes, which do not have any other FA pathway components. Yeast SLX4, like human SLX4 interacts with orthologs of ERCC4/XPF and SLX1 and the work in this model organism will provide insight into the function of the FA pathway in human cells. Since germ-line mutations in three FA genes (_FANCD1/BRCA1, FANCN/PALB2, FANCJ/BRIP1_) and _RAD51C_, mutated in an FA-like disorder, are associated with a high risk of developing familial breast and ovarian cancers, _SLX4_ should also be sequenced in patients from pedigrees where no other predisposing mutations could be identified.

Cell lines and genomic DNA samples were derived from individuals with Fanconi anemia and their family members registered in the International Fanconi Anemia Registry after obtaining informed written consent. The Institutional Review Board of The Rockefeller University approved the studies. U2OS cells were grown in Dulbecco Modified Eagle medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% (v/v) FBS, 100 units of penicillin per ml, and 0.1 mg streptomycin per ml (all from Invitrogen). Lymphoblast cell lines were grown in RPMI supplemented as above except with 20% FBS. Fibroblasts were grown as above except with 15% FBS and non-essential amino acids. Fibroblasts were grown in 3% oxygen. BJ cells are normal foreskin fibroblasts and were obtained from ATCC. Patients fibroblasts were immortalized using a catalytic subunit of telomerase (hTERT) or were transformed using HPVE6 and E7 proteins. RNA was extracted from the cell lines using Qiagen RNeasy Plus Mini Kit. First strand cDNAs were then synthesized using the Invitrogen SuperScript III Reverse Transcriptase kit. SLX4 RT-PCR was done using primers 621 and 624 (see ) and Invitrogen Platinum Pfx DNA Polymerase kit. PCR products were cleaned up using USB Exo-sapit kit before set up for sequencing, done by Genewiz, Inc. (NJ). Primers 623, 627, 628, 629, 630, 633, 634,639, 640, and 641 were used to sequence the full length SLX4 (see. Genomic PCR was done using Qiagen Taq Polymerase with primers shown in. The PCR products were cleaned up using USB Exo-sapit kit before set up for sequencing. In most cases, the PCR primers were also suitable for sequencing. In order to identify the second allele in RA 3331 cell line, full genomic sequencing of the coding exons was done on the patients and the maternal DNA. A genomic deletion was found likely, based on informative polymorphic markers in exon 12: c.3162G>A (p.S1054S, rs76488917), c.3365C>T (p.P1122L, rs714181). Amplification of parts of the cDNA followed by the detailed sequence analysis revealed retention of IVS9 through c.2013+224, with deletion of c.2013+225_3147 and insertion of two cytosine nucleotides in its place: hence c.2013+225_3147del4890insCC. To confirm this result, a genomic PCR assay was set up using primers flanking the deletion. The resulting wild-type amplicon (6821bp) failed to amplify under the PCR conditions we used but the deleted allele, resulted in a 1931bp amplicon from the patients and the mothers DNA, but not the fathers DNA. Direct sequencing of the mutant amplicon confirms the result observed in the cDNA. The sequencing result appears homozygous since the wild type allele does not amplify. The WT SLX4 cDNA was a kind gift from the Harper lab. Mutant alleles were amplified and recombined into pDONR223. pDONR223 derivatives were recombined into pHAGE vectors or pDEST15 using LR clonase (Invitrogen). HPV16 E6E7 genes (gift from Howley lab) were subcloned into pMSCVneo (Clontech) and used to transform the primary cells. pWZLhTERT was used to immortalize RA3083 and BJ cell lines. The following antibodies were used: FANCD2 (Novus NB100-182), GFP (Roche 11814460001), HA (Covance MMS-101R), SLX4 (Bethyl A302-269A and A302-270A) ERCC4/XPF (Neomarkers Ab-1), ERCC1 (Neomarkers Ab-2) Mus81 (Abcam, MTA30 2G10/3), Ubiquitin (Millipore, MAB1510) and an antibody raised against aa 251-402 of SLX4 (Bethyl). Mutagenesis was performed using multisite mutagenesis kit (Agilent) using primers shown in. siRNA transfections were performed using LipofectamineRNAiMAX as suggested by the manufacturer with the final siRNA concentration of 50 nM. siRNAs (Invitrogen) are shown in. Superscript III reverse transcriptase followed by Platinum cybergreen super mix (Invitrogen) were used according to the manufacturers instructions. Actin was used as control. 5 g purified GST SLX4_aa251-402, GST SLX4_aa251-402 ZNF1andZNF2 mutants or GST alone as a control were added to 7.5 l GST-beads and 1 g mono-Ub, Ub-K48 or Ub-K63 (Boston Biochem) in 100 l binding buffer (50 mM Tris pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 10% glycerol, 0.1% Triton, 2 mM NEM, 200 g/ml BSA) and incubated for 3 hours at 4C. After washing 5 times with binding buffer, the samples were boiled and loaded on a Bis-Tris gel (Invitrogen) and immunoblotted with anti-ubiquitin antibody (Millipore, MAB1510). For cell cycle analysis, cells were left untreated or were treated with 100 nM MMC and were grown for 48 hours. Collected cells were resuspended in 300 l PBS. While vortexing, 700 l of ice cold 100% (v/v) ethanol were added drop-wise and the suspension was stored at 20C at least overnight. 30 min before FACS, cells were spun down, resuspended in propidium iodine (PI) mix (1 ml PBS, 10 l RNase [of stock solution of 20 mg/ml], 10 l PI [of stock solution of 1 mg/ml]), and analyzed using FACSCalibur (Becton Dickinson). Cell cycle analysis was performed using the FlowJo software (Tree Star, Inc). Cells were treated with 0.1 g DEB per mL of media for 72 hours, arrested with colcemid (0.17 ug per mL of media) for 20 minutes (LCL) or 2 hours for fibroblasts, harvested, incubated for 10 min at 37C in 0.075 M KCl, and fixed in the freshly prepared methanol:glacial acidic acid (3:1 vol/vol). Cells were stored at 4C and when needed dropped onto wet slides and air-dried at 40C for 60 minutes before staining with Karyomax Giemsa (Invitrogen) Gurr Buffer for 3 minutes. After rinsing with fresh Gurr Buffer followed by distilled water, the slides were fully dried 40C for 60 minutes and scanned using the Metasystems Metafer application. For immunoprecipitations, cells were lysed in MCLB (50 mM Tris, 150 mM NaCl and 0.5% NP-40) supplemented with protease Inhibitors (Roche), and phosphatase inhibitors (Calbiochem). 1 or 2 mg protein extract was incubated with 5 g of the indicated antibody and 10 l of Protein A/G PLUS-Agarose (Santa Cruz). Following five washes in lysis buffer, the immunoprecipitates were eluted in tris-Glycine SDS sample buffer and size-fractionated on Novex 38% Tris-Acetate gel (Invitrogen). Cells were plated in a 6-well plate in triplicate at a density of 2.5104 cells per well. 24 hours later, MMC was added at final concentrations from 0 to 100 nM. After 8 days in culture, cell numbers were determined using a Z2 Coulter Counter (Beckman Coulter). The cell number after MMC treatment was normalized to the cell number in the untreated sample to arrive at the % survival.
