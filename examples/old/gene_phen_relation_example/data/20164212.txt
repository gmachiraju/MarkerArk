Diazoxide-responsive hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia caused by _HNF4A_ gene mutations
The phenotype associated with heterozygous _HNF4A_ gene mutations has recently been extended to include diazoxide responsive neonatal hypoglycemia in addition to maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY). To date, mutation screening has been limited to patients with a family history consistent with MODY. In this study, we investigated the prevalence of _HNF4A_ mutations in a large cohort of patients with diazoxide responsive hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia (HH). We sequenced the _ABCC8_, _KCNJ11_, _GCK_, _GLUD1_, and/or _HNF4A_ genes in 220 patients with HH responsive to diazoxide. The order of genetic testing was dependent upon the clinical phenotype. A genetic diagnosis was possible for 59/220 (27%) patients. KATP channel mutations were most common (15%) followed by _GLUD1_ mutations causing hyperinsulinism with hyperammonemia (5.9%), and _HNF4A_ mutations (5%). Seven of the 11 probands with a heterozygous _HNF4A_ mutation did not have a parent affected with diabetes, and four _de novo_ mutations were confirmed. These patients were diagnosed with HI within the first week of life (median age 1 day), and they had increased birth weight (median +2.4 SDS). The duration of diazoxide treatment ranged from 3 months to ongoing at 8 years. In this large series, _HNF4A_ mutations are the third most common cause of diazoxide responsive HH. We recommend that _HNF4A_ sequencing is considered in all patients with diazoxide responsive HH diagnosed in the first week of life irrespective of a family history of diabetes, once KATP channel mutations have been excluded. 
Hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia (HH) is characterized by unregulated secretion of insulin, despite hypoglycemia. HH most commonly presents in the neonatal period with the clinical presentation ranging from mild, moderate to severe medically unresponsive hypoglycemia. Diazoxide is the first line of treatment for patients with HH. In the pancreatic -cell, glucose metabolism is coupled to insulin secretion by the adenosine triphosphate-sensitive potassium channels (ATP-sensitive KATP channels). Glucose metabolism results in an increase in the concentration of intracellular ATP, which binds to the Kir6.2 subunits to effect channel closure. This results in membrane depolarization and ultimately insulin secretion. Diazoxide binds to the SUR1 regulatory subunits and acts by keeping the KATP channels open, thereby preventing insulin secretion. Loss-of-function mutations in the _ABCC8_ and _KCNJ11_ genes encoding the SUR1 and Kir6.2 subunits of the KATP channel lead to either a reduction in the number of channels within the -cell membrane or a decrease in channel activity, and hence diazoxide treatment is often ineffective. Some of these patients may be managed with octreotide, but many will require a partial or near total pancreatectomy. A minority of cases have mutations with residual function that correlate with response to diazoxide. Diazoxide responsive HH can also result from activating mutations in the _GLUD1_ gene which encodes the intra-mitochondrial enzyme, glutamate dehydrogenase. The majority of patients with _GLUD1_ mutations have hyperammonemia (HA). Rarer causes of diazoxide responsive HH include mutations in the _GCK_ or _HADH_ genes. Activating _GCK_ mutations show a variable phenotype but patients may be diagnosed outside the neonatal period, and some are responsive to diazoxide. _HADH_ mutations have been reported in five patients, and these mutations typically cause HH with associated defects in fatty acid oxidation. We have recently shown that loss-of-function mutations in the _HNF4A_ gene can also cause HH. The clinical severity ranges from mild transient hypoglycemia that does not require pharmacological treatment to persistent HH treated with diazoxide for up to 3 years. Heterozygous _HNF4A_ mutations result in increased birth weight (median increase 790g), macrosomia in 56%, and a form of maturity-onset diabetes of the young (HNF4A MODY) that shows sensitivity to low-dose sulfonylureas. All previous studies have described patients with hypoglycemia in families with known _HNF4A_ mutations recruited because of their history of diabetes, or selected for testing due to neonatal HH in a proband, where the family history was consistent with HNF4A MODY. The prevalence of _HNF4A_ mutations in patients referred for genetic testing due to a diagnosis of HH has not been investigated. We now report the genetic and clinical characteristics in a large cohort (_n_=220) of patients with diazoxide responsive HH. We studied 220 patients with diazoxide responsive HH who did not require pancreatectomy. Diazoxide responsiveness was defined as the ability to come off i.v. glucose and maintain normoglycemia. Patients with evidence of perinatal asphyxia were excluded from the cohort. The cohort included referrals via the UK Genetic Testing Network () and international cases (_n_=111). Clinical data were provided via a standard request form (), clinical letter of referral, or by case note review. The age at diagnosis ranged from birth to 15 years (median 1 week), and 61% of the cohort were male (see for clinical characteristics of the cohort). Macrosomia was defined as a birth weight of 1.3 SDS (equivalent to the 90th centile). The study was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki (2000). Genomic DNA was extracted from peripheral leukocytes using standard procedures, and the coding exons and intron/exon boundaries of the _ABCC8_, _KCNJ11_, _GCK_, _GLUD1_, and _HNF4A_ genes were amplified by PCR (primers available on request). _HNF4A_ analysis included the coding exons 1d10 and the P2 pancreatic promoter. PCR products were sequenced using standard methods on an ABI 3730 (Applied Biosystems, Warrington, UK), and were compared to the published sequence NM_000457.3 (exons 210) and AY680697 (exon 1d only) using Mutation Surveyor v3.2 (SoftGenetics, State College, PA, USA). The order of genetic testing depended on the clinical phenotype with sequencing of the _GLUD1_ gene performed in all the patients with HA. _ABCC8_, _KCNJ11, GCK_, and _HNF4A_ mutations were excluded in all the patients whose genetic diagnosis was not known. No patients in our cohort were reported to have defects in fatty acid oxidation (increased levels of 3-hydroxyglutaric acid or 3-hydroxybutyryl-carnitine), and therefore genetic analysis of the _HADH_ gene was not indicated. When an _HNF4A_ mutation was identified, parents were tested (if available) to establish the mode of inheritance, and microsatellite analysis (PowerPlex 16 System, Promega) was undertaken to confirm _de novo_ mutations. Novel non-synonymous variants were tested in ethnically matched control chromosomes. Clinical characteristics were obtained from patients' hospital records with assistance from their physician. HH was defined as a blood glucose level <3mmol/l with detectable serum insulin and/or c-peptide. Phenotypic data are presented as median (interquartile range), and comparative statistics used the MannWhitney _U_ test. The genetic etiology was determined in 59/220 (27%) probands. Thirty-three patients had a mutation in one of the KATP channel genes (5 _KCNJ11_ and 28 _ABCC8_; 4 with biallelic mutations). Thirteen probands were heterozygous for a _GLUD1_ mutation (patients previously reported ), and activating _GCK_ mutations were identified in two cases. A total of 11 different heterozygous _HNF4A_ mutations were identified in 11 probands ( and, see section on given at the end of this article). Two of these patients, with IVS2-21A>G (c.264-21A>G) and L330fsdel (c.987_1003del) mutations have been reported previously. One mutation, Y16X (c.48C>G), has previously been identified in another patient with hyperinsulinism (HI), while the remaining eight mutations are novel: R76W (c.226C>T), R80W (c.238C>T), C106S (c.317G>C), M116I (c.317G>A), L263P (c.789T>C), Y319fs (c.953dupA), L331_L332dup (c.992_997dupTGCTGC), and Q362X (c.1084C>T). L331_L332dup is likely to be pathogenic since a single leucine duplication mutation (p.Leu332dup) has been identified in three unrelated MODY probands (Sian Ellard, unpublished data and. Analysis of seven orthologous sequences demonstrated that the five novel missense mutations occurred at residues that are conserved through evolution, and these mutations were not present in 300 ethnically matched (Caucasian) control chromosomes. Four novel heterozygous _HNF4A_ variants were identified in a further four probands: c.621+4A>G (IVS5nt+4A>G), V94M (c.280G>A), S371R (c.1113C>A), and H378del (c.1133_1135delACC). In one patient, the c.621+4A>G variant was inherited from their unaffected father (current age 33 years), _in silico_ splicing prediction software suggested no effect on splicing (), and it was present in 2/76 ethnically matched (Bangladeshi) control chromosomes. Family member testing for the three remaining patients demonstrated inheritance of the variant from an unaffected grandparent (aged 71, 50, and 52 years respectively) and parent. Normal blood glucose levels and HbAlc were confirmed in two of these grandparents (S371R and H378del; V94M not tested). The penetrance of _HNF4A_ mutations causing diabetes is estimated at 74% by the age of 50 years (Sarah Flanagan, Sian Ellard, & Andrew Hattersley, unpublished data), and these variants were not identified in ethnically matched control chromosomes (300 Caucasian control chromosomes tested for V94M; 130 Turkish control chromosomes tested for S371R and H378del). We conclude that these four novel variants are unlikely to be pathogenic. In 4/11 families, the mutation was inherited from a diabetic parent (for pedigrees see. One patient had inherited a Y319fs mutation from her unaffected father (current age 39 years), but her paternal aunt who had gestational diabetes at 30 years was also found to carry the mutation. The proband with the L331_L332dup mutation had inherited it from her unaffected mother, but the maternal grandparents were not available for testing. Four mutations, R76W, C106S, M116I, and Q362X, were proven by microsatellite analysis to have arisen _de novo._ In the remaining family, with a Y16X mutation, the mode of inheritance could not be established as the child was conceived by ovum donation. Age at diagnosis was provided for 10/11 probands with a _HNF4A_ mutation, and all ten patients were diagnosed within the first week of life (median age 1 day, range 17 days;. The majority of patients (9/11) were macrosomic as defined by a corrected birth weight of 1.3 s.d.s from the mean. The median birth weight for the 11 cases was +2.4 SDS (see and. The duration of diazoxide treatment for all 11 patients ranged from 3 months to ongoing at 8 years, with seven patients having persistent HI as defined by a requirement for diazoxide at the age of 1 year. Two of the remaining probands are currently under 12 months of age, and are still requiring diazoxide. One proband subsequently developed diabetes at the age of 12 years. Two unaffected parents were found to be heterozygous mutation carriers, but in the absence of a formal OGTT, impaired glucose tolerance cannot be excluded. None of the ten heterozygous relatives reported a history of neonatal hypoglycemia. The clinical characteristics of the probands were compared according to genetic etiology. Patients with a _HNF4A_ mutation presented earlier, and were born heavier than patients with a _GLUD1_ mutation (1 day versus 24 weeks, _P_=0.0006 and +2.4 SDS versus 0.29 SDS, _P_=0.0003 respectively). No differences in the age at diagnosis or birth weight were observed between patients with an _HNF4A_ or KATP channel mutations (1 day versus 4 days, _P_=0.084 and +2.4 SDS versus +1.27 SDS, _P_=0.052). We identified a genetic etiology in 27% of patients with diazoxide responsive HH. KATP channel mutations were most common, accounting for 15% of cases. _HNF4A_ mutations have only been reported previously in five probands with diazoxide responsive neonatal hypoglycemia, but we found _HNF4A_ mutations in a further nine cases, making this the third most common genetic etiology within the cohort and the second most common cause of isolated diazoxide responsive HH. A further four novel heterozygous _HNF4A_ variants (one intronic and three non-synonymous amino acid substitutions) were identified, but are thought unlikely to be pathogenic mutations. _HNF4A_ mutations were associated with an early age of diagnosis (median 1 day) and increased birth weight (median birth weight +2.4 SDS with macrosomia in 9/11) which is likely to result from increased insulin secretion _in utero._ Seven of the eleven probands (64%) did not have a diabetic parent, and in four cases, a _de novo_ mutation was confirmed. Therefore, the absence of a family history of diabetes should not preclude sequencing of the _HNF4A_ gene in patients presenting with diazoxide responsive HH. Neonatal hypoglycemia has been reported in only a minority of patients (11%) with _HNF4A_ mutations who were ascertained by their family history of MODY, and none of the ten heterozygous relatives in our study were known to have had neonatal hypoglycemia. The reason(s) for the incomplete penetrance of symptomatic hypoglycemia are not known, although it appears to be a general feature rather than mutation specific. It is also possible that some patients had unrecognized hypoglycemia in the neonatal period. The hyperinsulinemic _HNF4A_ phenotype ranges from increased birth weight (macrosomia in 50% mutation carriers) to neonatal hypoglycemia managed by i.v. glucose only for 19 days, or neonatal hypoglycemia requiring diazoxide therapy for between 3 months and 8 years. It is therefore likely that other environmental and genetic factors are influencing the severity of the hyperinsulinemic phenotype associated with _HNF4A_ mutations. The mechanism underlying the biphasic phenotype of neonatal hypoglycemia with later diabetes is not known. It has been speculated to result from differences in HNF-4-dependent temporal gene expression, or early hypersecretion of insulin resulting in later -cell exhaustion. Patients with an _HNF4A_ mutation were diagnosed with HH within the first week of life (data available for 10/11 patients). The overlap in age at diagnosis and birth weight between patients with _HNF4A_ and KATP channel mutations means that it is not possible to distinguish between these two etiologies on an individual patient basis. Although diagnosis in the first week of life and a family history of young-onset diabetes suggest a _HNF4A_ mutation, given the higher prevalence of KATP channel mutations and the high rate of diabetes phenocopies in the population, we recommend sequencing _KCNJ11_ and _ABCC8_ first, followed by _HNF4A._. The frequency of _HNF4A_ mutations approached that of _GLUD1_ mutations (5 vs 5.9%). Patients with a _GLUD1_ mutation were diagnosed later (median 24 weeks), were of normal birth weight, and most (12/13) had HA. However, the recent description of a patient with a _GLUD1_ mutation, extreme protein sensitivity but normal serum ammonium suggests that this prevalence could be an underestimate. A genetic diagnosis was only possible for 27% of patients in this study, suggesting that there are more gene(s) harboring causative mutations which remain to be identified in patients with HH. In conclusion, we have shown that _HNF4A_ mutations are a relatively common cause of diazoxide responsive HH diagnosed in the first week of life. A genetic diagnosis is important for these patients as it predicts the likelihood of later sulfonylurea-sensitive diabetes and a high risk of having macrosomic babies. We therefore propose that _HNF4A_ should be sequenced in all the patients without a KATP channel mutation who present with diazoxideresponsive HH in the first week of life irrespective of a family history of diabetes.
