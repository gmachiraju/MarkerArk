The primary objective of MarkerArk is to develop an automated data extraction pipeline from published scientific publications (via PubMed) and subsequently populate Markerville, a web-based biomarker database constructed by Mallick Lab. Using the natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning elements of DeepDive, this program will programmatically read through literature, aggregate the data, and upload it to Markerville. Through this tool's efficient (and hopefully accurate) identification of biomarkers from thousands of works, the hope is to render the process of manually gathering biomarker and patient data unnecessary.

The initial version of the software will simply extract biomarkers along with the diseases they are frequently associated with and will be limited to sentences with simple structures. As further development occurs however, the software will also collect information regarding the medium in which the biomarker is found, the method of data collection, drugs in which the biomarker is used, the type of biomarker, the stage of the disease during which a biomarker is present, etc. Following this, data about the clinical trials themselves (number of trials, number of patients sampled, levels of the biomarkers in the patients, and other patient background information) will be collected. By repeatedly training the software using DeepDiveâ€™s machine learning features, the accuracy of the software will be maximized.
